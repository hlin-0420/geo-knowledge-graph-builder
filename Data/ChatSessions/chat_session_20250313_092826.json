However, it does not specify a maximum number of curves per file.\n\nAnother relevant document is Document 27, which states: \"Curve shade name length\" with a value of 20. This might imply that the maximum curve name length is 20 characters, but it doesn't provide information on the maximum number of curves you can load in a single data file.\n\nBased on these documents, I couldn't find any specific information on the maximum number of curves you can load in a data file.",
