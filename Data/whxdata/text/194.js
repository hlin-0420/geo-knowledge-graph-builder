However, the information within the XML file is structured differently so viewing the files contents prior to importing is slightly different. This specific structuring is called ","WellLogML","."," ","WellLogML is similar to LAS, in that it specifies how well log data is organized in terms of Well Information, Curve Information, Parameter Information, etc."," ","For more information about XML as a file format, please review the section on"," ","Exporting Curve Data to XML Format",", where we have links to relevant official websites on the subject."," ","On the ","GEO"," tab, select ","Import",". The Open dialog box will open."," ","Select the XML file and ","Open",". The WellLogML Information dialog box will open. This contains 3 tabs; Global, Parameters and Curves. "," ","Global","\n        General information contained within the XML file is detailed. ","File ","name"," and path, related ","File ","ID ","and ","Data"," ","depth ","parameters are all included. You may enter information on the authors or suppliers of the XML file in the field marked ","Vendor ","name",".

The XML Tag is taken from the original data set. The information displayed here can be compared to the Well Information section of a LAS file."," ","\n        The Tag is essentially the title of the data, for example Well Name would be a common tag to appear here. You then get the opportunity to supply a ","mnemonic"," ","to this tag. The mnemonic used in the ODF can then be assigned to this tag and the XML value for that tag can therefore be applied to the specified mnemonic.\n      "," ","Parameters","\n        This table displays Parameter-Mnemonic information from the WellLogML file: the mnemonic, its Unit, Description and Value."," ","Curves","\n        Information on the curves that you wish to load are displayed here.
