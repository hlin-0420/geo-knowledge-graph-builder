Sometimes, the data is presented in columns which are delimited by SPACES. Such Text files MUST be prepared (externally or within GEO before they can be loaded to the ODF database."," ","Yes"," ","Yes"," ","Comma Separated Values (ASCII)"," ","CSVData_load"," ","Some service companies present mudlog data as comma separated values.
