In each such segment, up to ten pixels can be turned on and up to another ten pixels can be turned off."," ","For example, a solid line could be defined either as:"," ","a single segment, 1 dot on, zero dots off"," ","a single segment, 2 dots on, zero dots off"," ","five segments, each with 10 dots on, zero dots off"," ","\n      Note",". Pens consisting of longer definitions (all five segments defined, for example) draw more efficiently than those with shorter definitions (only one segment defined)."," ","\n    Since there is a large difference in the resolutions (pixels/dots per inch) between display-devices and printer-devices, the software has two different definitions for the same pen: one for the display-device and the other for the printer-device."," ","\n    For example, the display-definition of a dash pen might consist of four pixels on, four pixels off, four pixels on, and so on while the printer-definition of the same dash pen might consist of ten pixels on, ten pixels off, ten pixels on, and so on. The number difference is due to the generally higher resolution on the printer than the monitor (display)."," ","\n    Another important attribute of a pen is its type. This attribute determines the thickness (and the shape) of a pen. The software currently supports the following pen-types:"," ","Single pixel"," ","Two, three, four or five pixels side-by-side."," ","A square two, three, four or five pixels on each side."," ","Define a New Curve Pen"," ","On the ","Curves"," tab, select ","Curve"," ","Settings",".
