This ensures that preferred components, such as library files (i.e. lithology, headers with included location maps, symbols, modifiers) are incorporated into the template. Any plot objects in the ODF will also be incorporated into the template saved."," ","\n    Once an ODT file has been created, it may be distributed to other users. "," ","\n    The ODT file is a powerful tool when a final log format has been approved.
