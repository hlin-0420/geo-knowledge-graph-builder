This data happens to be corrupt and upon mailing, the recipient experiences difficulty loading the OUF.

This OUF cannot be loaded by the user in the operation base, since the last OUF loaded successfully was 006 and the OUFs must be loaded in sequence."," ","The wellsite user can click ","Resave Range of OUF Updates"," from the ","GEO ","menu and select the 007.ouf from the list in the ","Description"," ","column of the dialog box."," ","Clicking ","Save"," ","will create a 007_009.ouf. The 007_ portion of this filename is created because the operations user must have a 007.ouf to maintain the sequence. The _009 portion is created because the wellsite user created a 008.ouf incorrectly. This must now be by-passed since the 008.ouf required the original 007.ouf to load correctly."," ","The next OUF created by the wellsite user will be 010.ouf. The operations user will be able to load this 010.ouf because the last OUF loaded was the 007_009.ouf and the _009 portion of this OUF maintains the sequence."," ","If an OUF sequence is ever broken, for any reasons, the ","Resave Range of OUF Updates"," option from the ","GEO ","menu can be utilized to successfully re-establish the link."," ","If the recipient user accidentally deleted the child ODF and the constituent OUFs, the link could always be re-established as long as the parent ODF exists."," ","In an extreme scenario, the wellsite user, after saving 1000 OUFs could click ","Re-Save Range of OUF Updates"," and select number 001.ouf from the dialog box list. GEO would then create a 001_1001.ouf, which would include every well data amendment and addition in those 1000 OUFs.
