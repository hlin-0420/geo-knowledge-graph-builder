The master resource for table templates is the ","GeoTable.ini"," file which houses all the information needed to create a table. GEO will use this set of templates for every new ODF made on a particular machine. However, once an ODF or ODT is created the table templates are automatically saved in the document so that the template list is also saved if the file is to be shared and perhaps modified on another machine. It is now far easier for template information to stay integral and thus safer. Similarly, if a colleague sends you an ODF the templates would be inherent in the document, there would not be as before the possibility of the document reading your own master GeoTable.ini file.\n  "," ","You can load and export"," ","a GeoTable.ini file, if for example changes are made remotely and an easy update for a colleague or partner to accept an updated INI file, rather than a whole ODF.
