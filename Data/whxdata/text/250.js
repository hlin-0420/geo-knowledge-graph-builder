The default value of 1 is 100% zoom. To increase the zoom enter a value greater than 1. To reduce the zoom, enter a value less than 1. "," ","Note",". The X (width of the plot) and Y (length of the plot) zooms can be altered independently.

If the value entered in this box is too small, it may cause inconvenience by frequent interruptions while the software creates a backup, especially when the file is large.
