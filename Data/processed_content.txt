At the time frequency specified, GEO will revert to the specified file and if new data is present, this will be loaded (appended) and the curve extended to reflect the new data.



You can load data files or either comma-separated (CSV) or tab-delimited text type without additional manipulated via theData Import Wizard.In a comma-delimited ASCII file, cells in a column are separated from the next by a comma, while in a tab-delimited ASCII file, cells in a column are separated from the next by a comma, while in a tab-delimited ASCII file, cells are separated by a tab character.In a comma-delimited ASCII file, cells in a column are separated from the next by a comma, while in a tab-delimited ASCII file, cells are separated by a tab character.In those kinds of files, the range between commas or tabs is taken as the column width.The application simply reads values between commas (or tabs) and ignores any spaces.Compared tospace-delimited data, these are more structured formats, and as such (together with the wholly structured LAS format, or compatible-XML format) are the preferred data formats to request from your vendors.





The data import wizard loads curves into an odf.

Data Import Wizard Step 1

Data Import Wizard Step 2



The process of importing or loading an XML file is very similar to that of loading other types of data. However, the information within the XML file is structured differently so viewing the files contents prior to importing is slightly different. This specific structuring is calledWellLogML.

WellLogML is similar to LAS, in that it specifies how well log data is organized in terms of Well Information, Curve Information, Parameter Information, etc.

For more information about XML as a file format, please review the section onExporting Curve Data to XML Format, where we have links to relevant official websites on the subject.

On theGEOtab, selectImport. The Open dialog box will open.

Select the XML file andOpen. The WellLogML Information dialog box will open. This contains 3 tabs; Global, Parameters and Curves.

GlobalGeneral information contained within the XML file is detailed.Filenameand path, relatedFileIDandDatadepthparameters are all included. You may enter information on the authors or suppliers of the XML file in the field markedVendorname. The vendor name will appear in the Curve Data History.StartandEndDepthsare filled in automatically as is theSamplingmode,DepthIncrement,Unitsand theFileNamingSystem.The table window near the bottom of the dialog box contains the XML Tags and their corresponding XML value. The XML Tag is taken from the original data set. The information displayed here can be compared to the Well Information section of a LAS file.The Tag is essentially the title of the data, for example Well Name would be a common tag to appear here. You then get the opportunity to supply amnemonicto this tag. The mnemonic used in the ODF can then be assigned to this tag and the XML value for that tag can therefore be applied to the specified mnemonic.

ParametersThis table displays Parameter-Mnemonic information from the WellLogML file: the mnemonic, its Unit, Description and Value.

CurvesInformation on the curves that you wish to load are displayed here. TheCurve Mnemonic,Unit,NameandDescriptionalong withNullValueare listed for each curve within the XML file.The last column,Load?, gives you the opportunity to deselect any curves that you do not wish to load. By default all curves within the XML file will be loaded. To deselect a curve, click the cell in the Load column for that curve (row) and type ‘N’. Type the letter ‘Y’ for yes if you decide to again load the curve.

SelectApplyto save any changes, thenOKto load.





In a space-delimited ASCII data file, cells in a column are separated from the next, by one or more spaces.As the number of the spaces may not be constant between columns, the width of each column needs to be explicitly specified.Note. It is very important to have the curve mnemonic, unit and data for each curve to lie within successive columns, and for the first row of data to be the curve mnemonic (column name).In theStep 1 of the Data Import Wizard, adjust the column widths manually.

Ensure that the first row of the data file is fixed as the Curve Mnemonics (column names), by scrolling the data, as required, until the curve mnemonics are central within the text box field.

ClickSet 1st Heading Lineto obscure any spurious leading data such as well name, run number, etc. from GEO. (Remember to instruct the data provider NOT to include such content on the next file provided).

Click anywhere in a data column to select its separator (vertical line), such that the separator color turns from black to red.

Click theMove selected Column edgeplus and minus buttons to move the separator to the right and left respectively.Note. Moving a column separator causes all other separators to the right of it to move by the same amount.

Align the separator hard against the right edge of the data column, leaving no spaces.

Repeat steps 3 to 6 for each column that requires realignment of the separator.

ClickOKto close theFile Viewdialog box.

It is highly recommended that you scroll through the entire file to ensure the correct positioning of all column separators.Ensure that the last entry in the file is the last row of data values, and not other spurious information.



The order of curve legends on a plot is determined by the curve order in curve settings list.

By default, the order in the curve settings list is the same order as the order in the file, from which the curves were loaded.

On theCurvestab, selectCurve Settings. The Curve Settings sidebar will open.

Open theCurvelist and inSortby, selectUserDefined.

Select the curve and use theOrderup and down arrows to arrange the curves.

Note. The Curve ID (number) remains the same, even though the order changes. If you choose toSort by Number, the curves appear in the same order as when loaded (numerical order).



The display settings for each curve, such as curve mnemonic, scale, pen type, pen color, name and measurement units,auto populatecapabilities etc., can besaved as defaults.

These defaults can then be applied in a new ODF.

On theCurvestab, selectCurveSettings. The Curve Settings sidebar will open.

Select theCurve, thenClosethe list.Note. The curve mnemonic must match that of the saved defaults or be a synonym of it.

SelectApplyDefaults.Note. The Apply Defaults button will only enabled if a default has been saved for this mnemonic.

Note. The defaults are stored within the geocurve.ini file. The correct geocurve.ini file needs to be loadedin order for the saved defaults to be available.



This feature allows you to save curve display attributes, that will enable a curve - when loaded or computed - to automatically display as desired. This is advantageous when used in a corporate template, so that from the start of a well you can view data immediately.

Curve display attributes, are defined in theCurveSettingssidebar (on theCurvetab, selectCurveSettings), and are saved as 'Curve Defaults' to the geocurve.ini file, which is then saved in the ODF/ODT.

Note. The curve defaults are linked to the curve mnemonic (or relative synonym) so please ensure that these mnemonics are correct for the curve you are setting up.

Customize the way pens appear on the screen and on the printer using in Pen Definitions.

Up to twenty (20) customized pens can be defined (pen 0 through 19).

By default, pens 0 through 9 are predefined to represent normal thickness pens, and pens 10 through 19 are predefined to represent thicker pens.

When you save your plot-information in an ODF file, this definition of the pen is also stored in the same file.

A pen definition consists of (up to) five segments of dot-combinations. In each such segment, up to ten pixels can be turned on and up to another ten pixels can be turned off.

For example, a solid line could be defined either as:

a single segment, 1 dot on, zero dots off

a single segment, 2 dots on, zero dots off

five segments, each with 10 dots on, zero dots off

Note. Pens consisting of longer definitions (all five segments defined, for example) draw more efficiently than those with shorter definitions (only one segment defined).

Since there is a large difference in the resolutions (pixels/dots per inch) between display-devices and printer-devices, the software has two different definitions for the same pen: one for the display-device and the other for the printer-device.

For example, the display-definition of a dash pen might consist of four pixels on, four pixels off, four pixels on, and so on while the printer-definition of the same dash pen might consist of ten pixels on, ten pixels off, ten pixels on, and so on. The number difference is due to the generally higher resolution on the printer than the monitor (display).

Two, three, four or five pixels side-by-side.

Data points in a curve can be marked on the plot.

However, since these appear at actual data points, using such markers on a curve with a sample frequency of 0.5 ft (6 inch) on a 1:500 scale would cause the markers to overlap each other.

Data point markers are therefore normally used on those data, which may not have a fixed sample frequency, such as shale density, or core porosity or permeability analyses.

On theCurvestab, selectCurveSettings. The Curve Settings sidebar will open.

Select theCurve, thenClosethe list.

A tadpole plot is used to present four data sets in graphical format.

The four data sets are:

Dip/Deviation:thesevalues must fall between 0 and 90 degrees

Azimuth:these values must fallbetween 0 and 360 degrees

Quality:this data is optional and normally represented by a % figure

Dip Type:this data is optional. It consists of integers which represent specific dip types

TheDip/Deviationis represented by the position of the tadpole body on the track where the track edges reflect the two extremes of dip; 0 and 90 degrees.

TheAzimuthis depicted by the orientation of the  tadpole  ‘tail’.

TheQualityis reflected by the ‘fill’ of the tadpole body. Four quality thresholds can be defined.

TheDipTypecan be reflected either by the tadpole color or the 'Dip Name' which displays in the track legend.

Shade between the wrapped (or out-of scale value) curves and the left or right track edge.

For example, an ROP curve that has data range between 0 to 380 ft/min needs to be displayed with left and right edge scale at 0 to 300 ft/min. To indicate a fast drilling region, a red curve shading needs to be applied between left track edge and any ROP curve whose value is greater than 300 ft/min.

Ensure that the ROP curve hasbeenwrapped right at least once, so the out-of-scale curve will be displayed on the track.

On theCurvestab, selectCurveShading. TheCurveShadingInformationdialog box will open.

FromCurveShading, select an unused number.

TickDisplayCurveShade on Layout.

Enter a curve shadingName.

Select theTrackwhere the ROP curve displays.

InShadeFrom, select<left edge of track>.

InTo, select the wrappedROPcurve and tickWrappedbelow.

ClickAppendand select the shading color asRed.

Only the wrapped ROP (i.e. its value exceeding 300 ft/min) will then be shaded red.



Take portions of different curves and splice them together to form a new curve. The selected source curve is spliced onto the destination curve over the specified depth interval.

In general, the splicing operation is appropriate only for wireline curves. This is because each wireline curve has its own first and last reading and curves need to be spliced to eliminate or minimize data falling outside these points.

TheFile IDof a spliced curve is[Spliced], indicating that the data is not original.You are only able to splice curves into[Unused]or[Spliced]destinations so that the original data is left intact in case a spliced curve needs to be recreated with different splice points.

Mudlog data, on the other hand, should be appended rather than spliced as the data provided on a daily basis from the mudloggers constitute part of a continuous data-set.

However, sometimes, to satisfy the requirement of presenting ROP with different scales over different zones, the one ROP curve may be split up into the different zones using the splice function.

On theCurvestab, selectSplice. TheCurveSplicingdialog box will open.

Select a curve fromSource Curve. The depth range of the curve will be displayed at the side.

InSelect range to copyenter the start and end depth respectively. The depth range entered must be the same or a subset of the source curve depth range.

Shade between the wrapped (or out-of scale value) curves and the left or right track edge.

For example, an ROP curve that has data range between 0 to 380 ft/min needs to be displayed with left and right edge scale at 0 to 300 ft/min. To indicate a fast drilling region, a red curve shading needs to be applied between left track edge and any ROP curve whose value is greater than 300 ft/min.

Ensure that the ROP curve hasbeenwrapped right at least once, so the out-of-scale curve will be displayed on the track.

On theCurvestab, selectCurveShading. TheCurveShadingInformationdialog box will open.

FromCurveShading, select an unused number.

TickDisplayCurveShade on Layout.

Enter a curve shadingName.

Select theTrackwhere the ROP curve displays.

ClickAppendand select the shading color asRed.

Only the wrapped ROP (i.e. its value exceeding 300 ft/min) will then be shaded red.



Take portions of different curves and splice them together to form a new curve. The selected source curve is spliced onto the destination curve over the specified depth interval.

In general, the splicing operation is appropriate only for wireline curves. This is because each wireline curve has its own first and last reading and curves need to be spliced to eliminate or minimize data falling outside these points.

TheFile IDof a spliced curve is[Spliced], indicating that the data is not original.You are only able to splice curves into[Unused]or[Spliced]destinations so that the original data is left intact in case a spliced curve needs to be recreated with different splice points.

Mudlog data, on the other hand, should be appended rather than spliced as the data provided on a daily basis from the mudloggers constitute part of a continuous data-set.

However, sometimes, to satisfy the requirement of presenting ROP with different scales over different zones, the one ROP curve may be split up into the different zones using the splice function.

On theCurvestab, selectSplice. TheCurveSplicingdialog box will open.

Select a curve fromSource Curve. The depth range of the curve will be displayed at the side.

InSelect range to copyenter the start and end depth respectively. The depth range entered must be the same or a subset of the source curve depth range.

Select a curve fromDestination Curveon to which the source curve will be spliced. Initially, the destination curve must be an [Unused] one.

ClickSplice. The curve inDestination Curvewill then bear the same mnemonic as the source curve and have a File ID of[Spliced].

AnotherSourceCurvecan be selected and a new data set can be spliced, by leaving theDestinationCurvethe same as what you have in step 5.

ClickSpliceto then splice two different curves from theSourceCurveinto one curve (as specified in theDestination Curve).

If the source curve is being copied onto an existing curve, and there is an overlap between the source and destination curves, a dialog box will be presented.

Yes:overwrites the overlapping section of the destination curve with source curve values.

No:retains the destination curve values over the section of the overlap.

Cancel:aborts the operation.

The above process may be repeated on the same destination curve with other source curves.

The process of adding a Graph (a dynamic GGD file) to your ODF or ODT is much the same as adding anything to a header or trailer.

If you are using Layouts, select the one you wish the graph to appear on.

On theEdittab, selectHeaders and Trailers.The Plot Header and Trailer Specifications dialog box will open.

ClickLoad. The Open dialog box will open.

Locate and select the .ggd file you wish to import, then clickOpen.

The .ggd file will now appear in theExisting Specificationsdialog box.

Once a graph has been loaded into the header specifications it can be displayed on multiple layouts. Select the layout you wish to place the graph on and repeat steps 6 onward.

Tip.To make instant changes to a graph, double click the graph.



GEOGraph is an integrated application which allows you to create X-Y and Z plots from curve data or table data from within GEO. This Graphs can then be displayed in the header or trailer.

Uses can range from well trajectory plots through to pressure plots. Once the data is plotted, calculations of best-fit lines and line intersect can be achieved. This accompanied by full integration with GEO serves as a useful graphics tool.

Benefits of using GEOGraph

The focus throughout the GEO software Suite is to promote a minimal ‘time and effort’ logic. The GEO/GEOGraph integration is no different as once you have created your Graph and placed it in a header or trailer it becomes completelydynamic. Meaning if the data your graph is based on is changed or amended your GEOGraph document willautomatically update. This can be as a result of editing or importing Curve or Table data.

This also means if your GEOGraph document is set up in a blank ODT for example, when you load in applicable data, the GEOGraph document will automatically populate with the data.

You can invoke GEOGraph within a GEO document by double-clicking on the GEOGraph document displayed in the header or trailer area.

Learn how to adda graph (ggd file) to your ODF or ODT.

As part of the installation routine you will probably have installed a suite of example files and templates that have some example graphs already set up for you. Please feel free to experiment with these files and see how GEOGraph could benefit your well log.

Vector Object orVOBfiles may contain references to fixed text, mnemonics and tables.

Every text string that is displayed in the VOB file must have a font associated with it.

This association is defined in the VOB file in the form of a font number for each text string. When the software displays or prints text from any VOB file, it uses the font that has been specified in the VOB file.

The way the defined VOB fonts will appear in the plot is specified in theFonts for Vector Objects. To open this, on theDefinetab, selectFonts - VOBs.

If text in a header is created with font number 5, which is Arial 10 bold, it may look different on another PC that has Arial 6 regular as its font number 5.

You can use this dialog box to change the font type and size for this number 5 font, to get the same text fonts on both PCs.

When you receive anODFfile from another user, displaying the Fonts for Vector Objects will give information on the fonts that the other person uses. Therefore, this dialog box gives a fingerprint of how the VOB fonts were defined in the other session of the software, which has been used to create the ODF.

Details all fonts currently defined for Vector Objects. Each line briefly describes a single font. Select a font from this box prior to changing its attributes such as its type, size and orientation.

The number on the left is the font number. It is used to reference the font in VOB files.

The number is then followed by the font type (e.g. Arial).

The following number in parenthesis specifies the size of the font. The size may appear in two different formatspointsorheight.

When the format appears as height (e.g.12 height), it is the default definition of the font and specifies the complete height of the font including internal leading.

If this font is selected from this dialog box and updated usingChooseFont, the size is converted to a point size which does not include internal leading. So a font with a height of 12 would appear as 9 points.

This size is then followed by the font style, such as regular, bold or italic.

The header and trailer items can be rearranged to suit your requirements by establishing a hierarchy.

This is especially valuable when dealing with expanding data tables.

Note. Care must be taken when organizing the order in which items are displayed as some may need to be placed side-by-side, thus fore only one can serve as the parent.

As you can see from the image above, the LITHOLOGY LEGEND is dependent on the LITHOLOG HEADER.  This means that

any changes in the size or position of the header, will affect the LEGEND too. It looks like this on the plot.

In this example, the LITHOLOG HEADER is the parent and the LITHOLOG LEGEND is the child.

Setting up the hierarchy

Ensure the items you wish to display are in the Header Specifications and Trailer Specifications on the right side of the dialog box.Click to learn how to add items to headers and trailers.

Select the child item and drag it on to the parent, so that the parent item becomes highlighted, then release the mouse button.

The child item should then sit as a sub-header underneath the parent item.

Repeat this action to stack multi dependable items.

Note. Care must be taken when organizing the order in which items are displayed as some may need to be placed side

by-side, therefore only one serve as the parent.

Note. The itemsY Positionwill determine its distance from its parent.

Vertical Margin Between Last Header and Plot

Enter a value in screen units for the gap you wish to have between the last header and the plot (this is relevant only if you have an expanding table as your last header, otherwise the bounds can be used as the margin).



To add headers or trailers to your log, the required file should be present in theExisting Specificationsof thePlot Header and Trailer

In a plot header or trailer, you need to be able to fill in well or log information such as well name, field name, company name, vendors name, name of the geologists, coring intervals, casing intervals etc.

To do this, a specific mnemonic is assigned to each piece of information in the plot header or trailer. All mnemonics must be unique within the ODF file. The software uses the mnemonic ID to uniquely identify a mnemonic.

A mnemonic consists of the following;

Mnemonic Identifier (ID)

No or Yes (Yes enables the mnemonic value to display when selecting the .odf file in windows explorer)

Add mnemonic to header

The following steps demonstrate how to add a Field Name mnemonic to the header. If this mnemonic is added to the header of other layouts in the odf, then any changes made to the mnemonic Value will be changed in the other layout headers also.

Please note that mnemonics can only be added to headers if your license includes GEOVectdraw.

Once the header has been finalized, you will seeField Name: Drentin each ODF header:

Continuing the example above, the 'Field Name' (Mnemonic Description) and 'Drent' (Mnemonic Value) can be edited in GEO using one of these two methods;

Edit directly in the ODF by left clicking the mnemonic description or value in the plot header or trailer.

From theDefineMnemonicsdialog box - on theDefinetab, selectMnemonics. Here, you can also define pre-set values that can be selected from a drop list in the header.

Note. GEOVectDraw is not be required for these alterations. However, any changes made via these methods are only valid/happen in that particular ODF.

Add mnemonic values from Las Files : Information Blocks

When a LAS file is loaded to the GEO Software Suite, the software reads in and stores all the available mnemonics in theParameter Informationblock and theWell Informationblock from that particular LAS file. GEO then maintains these mnemonics on a per file basis. The data in these blocks forms the basis for the final values for each mnemonic in a particular log.

If data is loaded in a non-Las format, but you wish to export it from GEO into Las format, then mnemonics will not automatically have their information block assigned. However, this can be done manually in GEO.

On theDefinetab, selectMnemonics. The Define Mnemonics will open.

All data files loaded into the ODF will be available in theFiledrop down list at the top. The corresponding mnemonics from those files will be listed in the box directly below in the mnemonics area.

To add a mnemonic to the plot,

Multi-select by dragging the mouse over a range of entries in the mnemonics area, or holdCtrland click the individual mnemonics you wish to add. They should now have a blue highlight

ClickAdd to Plot.The appropriate header will now populate with the information provided the mnemonics in the header VOBmatch.

ClickExitto return to the plot area.

In thePlot Mnemonicssection to the right of the table you will see a column labeledInformation Block.

Enter the lettersP,WorOto stipulate which block you wish to assign the mnemonic to,Parameters,WellorOther.

Do this for each mnemonic you wish to appear in the required block and clickExit.

If you now wish to export a curve as XML, the mnemonics assigned as Parameter Information will now populate in the file.

Select the corresponding LAS file (from theFilelist box inDefine Mnemonicsdialog box) to determine the appropriate mnemonic values for your plot header.

The possible length of a mnemonic is 32 characters. The API standards have not changed, so most mnemonics will still be three or four characters, but you have the option of creating user defined mnemonics that are longer.

Add horizontal lithology descriptions or remarks to a special text track.

Double click on text track. The Track Text Entry dialog box will open.

In theHorizontaltexttab, enter the text.

Select aBackgroundColor

Justificationwithin the track

TextMargins– margin from the Left, Right, Top and Bottom of the track or box.

Add a box by selecting theBoxedText,Yescheck box.DefineaMarginfrom theLandRof the track,PenwidthandColor.

Some lithology descriptions may not be placed at its correct depth due to space limitations. If the text needs to be exported, theActual Depth Rangecan be specified in theStartandEndbox.

There are additional features in the Track Text Entry window which may not be required on a regular basis, but are explained by clickingherehere.

Display Text in Plot Mode- Choose to display the entry in specific plot modes by checking theTVD,TWTandVSECboxes in theDisplay Text in Plot Mode.Clearing the check box will prevent the track text from appearing on the plot whenever that specific mode is enabled. It does not remove them from the ODF, simply from the display.

Text Weightage- Choose to display the text entry when the plot scale is compressed (for example a change from 1:500 to 1:2000).Enter a weight of 100 to ensure the text carries the maximum weight and will always display, irrespective of plot scale.If the weight is less than 100, the text will display only if theCutoff Weight for Track Text(defined inEdit>Global Settings>Scale & Gridtab), is less than this specified weight.

Links- Add an external and/or internal link to the text.The link can provide additional or more detailed information.An example of an external link is a URL or Network location.An internal link could be using to associate the text with other GEO objects, such as a specification in the header or trailer.

To create or edit a link,

ClickLinks. The Create or Modify External and Internal Links for an Object will open.

Enter the desired URL in theExternal Linkor clickBrowseto locate the local or network item.

For anInternal link, select theHeaderorTrailerthen use the lists below to selectinLayoutandHeader/Trailer.

Choose to identify links using a marker in theLink Object on Screen Display with Link Markerlist.



Select the text and hitDeleteon your keyboard.

Right click on the text and selectDelete.

On theHometab, selectArrowsKeysNudge. Use the keyboard arrow keys to move the text to its new position.

A confirmation dialog box will open. ClickYes.

Using the Track Text Manager

Individual and multiple entries can be deleted via the track text manager which lists the information in a table format. This may be easier to navigate than locating entries on the plot.

On theToolstab, selectTrackTextManager.

Select theTrackcontaining the horizontal lithology descriptions or remarks text you wish to delete. The grid will populate will all text entries in the selected track.

Identify the entry you wish to delete and select the grey cell adjacent to highlight the row.Select as many rows are required.

Clear theIn-Usecheck box.

ClickUpdate.If multiple entries are selected a message will appear  - confirmYesto delete.



Double click on the text. In-place editing will invoke. Edit the text and hitEnter.Or,

Right click on the text and selectTrackTextProperties. Edit the text and selectApplyandClose.



Import text from another application (such as MS wordTM).

It should have the following format.

Select the text and copy to clipboard.

InGEO, on theToolstab, selectTrackTextManager.TheTrackTextManagerdialog box will open.

From theTrackList, select the track that you want to import the text into.

A confirmation dialog box will open. ClickYes.

Note.The imported text will adopt the current settings (such as fonts, text margins, justifications and text type).



Select the text and drag it upwards of downwards to its new position.

On theHometab, selectArrowsKeysNudge. Use the keyboard arrow keys to move the text to its new position.

Move lithology descriptions of remarks text with precision

On theToolstab, selectTrackText.TheTrackTextManagerwill open.

Enter the depth in theDisplayDepthsStartbox.



The Application Look refers to the GEO interface style.

If you wish to change this, open theToolstab and click onApplicationLook- a range of 'Looks' will invoke. Select as desired and the interface will automatically change.

To return to the classic GEO interface (i.e. non ribbons), on theToolstab, checkClassicView.



Your software level and version are written at the top at the GEO-About box that is invoked.

Apart from these software details, this box also provides the following information:

Additional modules, if any

ODF(Database) version

Licence name and licence number

Type of dongle (CodeMeter/Flexnet)

Note that it is the security-device (dongle) provided with your software that determines the level of your software (i.e. GEO or GEOLite), any supplied additional modules, and thus the accessible features.

The software version however is determined by the software installed from CD-ROM (or web-downloaded update).

You can therefore upgrade the level of your installation easily at any time (e.g. from GEOLiteto GEO) by simply substituting a new dongle supplied by Geologix Limited. You don’t need to re-install the application, except when upgrading from GEOLogger.



The following restrictions currently apply within each session of GEO, or instance ofODFfile.

Once a limit is reached, the system may beep and/or display an error message for that object type.

The Statistics dialog box displays the number of modifiers, lithologies, symbols, texts and lines, which are being used in the currently-open ODF.

The RUS (Remote Update Service) Dongle is specially configured to be used for rented licenses of our applications. This new style of renting gives greater flexibility for rental terms and also increased access to updates.

The clock on your machine now governs your rental periods. A license will run from one set date and time to another set date and time. The period between these two dates will be when you can access your GEO Software Suite application.

Should you require more time on the current rental or foresee a period where you may require the GEO Software Suite again, a new license file can be sent via e-mail to update your dongles validity.

The update file that is used to update the validity of your CodeMeter RUS license requires a.WibuCmRaUfile.

The update file is used to update the validity of your RUS dongle. The.WibuCmRaUfile contains the information pertaining to the rental period. These files can be sent directly via e-mail and can instantly be applied to gain access to GEO Software Suite applications.

Updating a License/License Expiry

This can be done in two ways depending on the current status of the license in the RUS dongle.

An extension can also be applied after the license has expired, this is detailed below.

If a rental period hasexpired.Attempting to run the application will invoke a dialog allowing you to browse to and apply a new license file (.WibuCmRaU). GEO will automatically run once the new license has been applied. If you do not have a license file and wish to request one, please follow the procedure below.

Requesting a Rental Update

If you are presented with a dialog box when accessing GEO you license has either expired or close to expiring.

Choose the appropriate option from the warning dialog. The Request License Renewal E-mail will invoke. You will see that some information is already pre-filled for you. All you have to do is supply the dates of your new rental period and fill in your personal/company (license) details.

On receipt of your request we shall provide a response e-mail notifying you that we are dealing with your request.

Opening/Applying a License Update File

Locate your.WibuCmRaUfile

Click on it so it appears in theFileNamesection.

ClickOKto apply the new license information.

New license Period activatedindication will appear.

Should you need to change your computers clock

Important. Usage Information is stored in the RUS dongle using your computers clock. If changing your machine time is required i.e. you are changing time zones, it is recommended that you use the Time Zones feature accessible through the WindowsÔclock, rather than changing your time manually. Changing the clock manually will disrupt the time configuration and you may risk losing time on your rental - or worse rendering your licencecompletely inaccessible.

Append curves from successive mud log, MWD or LWD data files to existing curves within the ODF to create a continuous set of curves.

To append, the following conditions must be applied.

Curve mnemonics for the new curve(s) to be loaded, must be the same as for the existing curve(s).

The data sets must be sequential.

Refer to the Load Curve Data instructions below.  When selecting the Data Source Type, the following selections will automatically append the curve data;

In step 2 of the data import wizard, select Append Overlapping Curves and Append Non-overlapping Curves as required.

On theGEOtab, selectImport.

In theOpendialog box, theFiles of Typebox lists the curve data types accepted. Select the type required.

Locate and select the curve data file, then clickOpen. Step 1 of the Data Import Wizard will invoke.

The curve dataTypewill be automatically detected.

Select theData Source Type. The selection will determine the default settings.

WirelineIdentical mnemonics willNOTappend automatically to preserve individual runs.

MWD/LWDMWD or LWD data curves may however be treatedeitheras discrete run for each curve, or as continuous curves.

MudlogContinuous dataWILLautomatically append.

MineralogyDataWILLappend regardless if the data continues or appears after a large interval.

OtherUndefined source type. Manual append required.

SelectNext. Step 2 of the Data Import Wizard will open.

Enter the data range to be loaded in theFromandToboxes.

Specify the Null (or pen-up) data values in theUse as Null data Value. The default is -999.25. If the data vendor has used a different value e.g. -999.99 define it here.

By default,Treat Null data value as “empty”will be cleared. In which case, GEO will ‘pen-up’ when it encounters null values within a curve. The curve will be discontinuous over any null intervals. SelectTreat Null data value as “empty”to draw a continuous curve. When a null value is encountered the curve will connect the previous valid value with the next valid value.

Edit the curveName,Mnemonic,Synonym,UnitsandTypeas required.

Elect to not load certain data by clicking on the column header. Or use theSelectAllorDeselectAllbuttons. Selected data will be black and deselected data will be red. If a mnemonic is not formatted in the curve default ini file, it will be blue.

ClickFinishto complete the wizard.



On theDefinetab, selectAutoLoad. The Auto Load Definitions dialog box will open.

For a first-time load, enter aNamefor the auto-file load andBrowseto locate and select the relevant curve data file. Alternatively, a file path can be manually typed intoFile Name.

InTimeinterval, specify the time frequency (seconds) that GEO will revert to the selected file to check for additional data.

ClickFirst Time LoadthenYesto confirm the newAuto File Load Specification.For a first-time load, GEO will invoke the standardLoadPreviewFileand thenLoadFiledialog boxes.

For loading the file, the same steps should be followed as whenloading a data file manually.

Once loaded, you can thenpresent the curvesas desired.

At the time frequency specified, GEO will revert to the specified file and if new data is present, this will be loaded (appended) and the curve extended to reflect the new data.



You can load data files or either comma-separated (CSV) or tab-delimited text type without additional manipulated via theData Import Wizard.In a comma-delimited ASCII file, cells in a column are separated from the next by a comma, while in a tab-delimited ASCII file, cells in a column are separated from the next by a comma, while in a tab-delimited ASCII file, cells are separated by a tab character.In a comma-delimited ASCII file, cells in a column are separated from the next by a comma, while in a tab-delimited ASCII file, cells are separated by a tab character.In those kinds of files, the range between commas or tabs is taken as the column width.The application simply reads values between commas (or tabs) and ignores any spaces.Compared tospace-delimited data, these are more structured formats, and as such (together with the wholly structured LAS format, or compatible-XML format) are the preferred data formats to request from your vendors.



On theToolstab, clickLIS to LAS.

A message displays detailing the number of constants that were loaded from the lis_cons.dat file. The constants or parameters in that file can be edited using any text editor such as WordpadTM. ClickOK.

TheOpendialog box will open. Select the LIS file to be loaded and clickOpen.

A list of logical files in that LIS file will be displayed. Click a logical file and all relevant details for that file (such as file name, generation date depth interval etc) will be displayed to aide the selection.

Type theNameof the LAS (output) file. By default, the LAS file will have same name as the loaded LIS file.



The data import wizard loads curves into an odf.

On theGEOtab, selectImport. The Open dialog box will open.

InLookIn, browse to the data file location.

Ensure the correctFiles of Typeis selected. Curve data can be imported as LAS or Text file.

Select the file and clickOpen. The Data Import Wizard: Step 1 of 2 will invoke.Data Import Wizard Step 1.

Data Import Wizard Step 1

Define the data fileType.

Delimited text files that conform to the Ascii standard will automatically be recognized.  TheDelimited Textbutton and the delimitation character (tab, comma etc.) will be selected.

Otherwise,Fixed Width Textwill be selected together with the delimitation character (if any).

For LAS files,LASwill be selected.

Select aData Source Type. This is required to continue to step 2 of the wizard.The data source type allows the curves to be grouped in the Curve Settings dialog box.

In most circumstancesCurveDatashould be selected.

Tadpole Datashould only be selected if the data you are loading is to beplotted in Tadpole format.

Imaging Datashould only be selected if the data you are loading is to be used in the creation of an LWD or Wireline imaging log.

Provide the data with a File ID. By default this field will display the name of the loaded text data.This can be useful in providing an audit trail, since the File ID will appear within theCurve Settings dialog box, showing which curves were loaded concurrently. There is also an option to refine the curve list displayed in curve settings based on the File ID.

Visually check the data prior to loading, within the lower scrollable panel of this wizard screen.

Choose the row of data which is recognized the and ‘first row’ using theSet the current Top Line as the Firstsection.

If you want to load data beginning from a depth (or time) other than the first data row in the file, scroll vertically so that the data row you want to start from is the topmost visible, then clickData Line.

If your file contains non-required information ahead or the row that contains the curve mnemonics, scroll vertically so that the line containing the curve mnemonics is the topmost visible, then clickHeader Line.

To load data which has TVD as the index, selectIndex contains TD values.Note. This data will only display when the log is in TVD mode.

ClickNextto proceed to Step 2 of the wizard.

Data Import Wizard Step 2

Define the curve data range you wish to load in theDepth FromandTo.By default GEO will list the depth range in the curve data file.

Specify theUse as Null data value. This is also know as the pen-up value. By default GEO uses -999.25 but this can be changed as required by your dataset.

Choose how to display the null data values using theTreat Null data values as "empty"check box.

Leave unchecked to 'pen-up' when null data values are encountered. The curve will stop drawing when null values are encountered, resulting discontinuous curve.

Check to draw a continuous curve joining the last good value with the next.

Load Data into a Contiguous set of Curves

By defaults, this will be checked. The data will be loaded as a 'block' of curves with consecutive curve numbers.

Uncheck to load curves into any empty curve number rows before filling previously un allocated rows in sequence.

Append Overlapping Curves. Check toappend overlapping curves,or uncheck to not append.  The default status is determined by the Data Source Type selection made in step 1 of the wizard.

For Wireline or Other types the check box will be unselected.

For MWD/LWD, Mudlog and Mineralogy, the check box will be selected.

Append Non-overlapping Curves. Check to append non-overlapping curves or uncheck to not append. The status of this checkbox is determined by the Data Source Type selected made in step 1 of the wizard.

For Mineralogy, the check box will be selected.

For all other types, the checkbox will be unselected.

At the bottom of the dialog box, there is a grid listing the curves being loaded.

Elect NOT to load certain curves by clicking on the column header. The values will turn red to indicate their deselected status.

Multiple columns (other than the Depth or Time index column #1) may be deselected as required. OrSelectAllto load all curve orDeselected Allto stop all curves loading.

The curveName.Mnemonic,Synonym,UnitsandTypecan be changed by typing in the cells.

ClickFinishto complete the import wizard and load the data.



GEO can load several different types of ASCII files, such as CWLAS (LAS), tab-delimited, space-delimited and comma-delimited.If the ASCII file is not a LAS file, there are some basic requirements to follow prior to loading.

The curve data must be laid out in rows and columns.

The first row of the file must contain the curve names or curve mnemonics (such as ROP, GR), and must not be blank.

The first column must always be depth.

Each curve mnemonic or unit must not contain any spaces and must not exceed thirty-two characters.

The last row of the file must be the last row of the data set.

The delimiter used at the first column must be same for rest for data. Thus, you cannot have a data file that is delimited by comma and tab.

As an option, the second row of the file may be the curve unit (such as ft/hr, %, or GAPI).

Deviation from the above may cause errors during loading data from files. When such errors occur, it is advisable to examine the data set to determine the cause of the problem.Tip. If possible, ask for LAS files from your data provider. LAS format is the easiest curve data format to load. If the vendor cannot provide LAS file, please ask them to give you the Tab-delimited ASCII file.



The process of importing or loading an XML file is very similar to that of loading other types of data. However, the information within the XML file is structured differently so viewing the files contents prior to importing is slightly different. This specific structuring is calledWellLogML.

WellLogML is similar to LAS, in that it specifies how well log data is organized in terms of Well Information, Curve Information, Parameter Information, etc.

For more information about XML as a file format, please review the section onExporting Curve Data to XML Format, where we have links to relevant official websites on the subject.

On theGEOtab, selectImport. The Open dialog box will open.

Select the XML file andOpen. The WellLogML Information dialog box will open. This contains 3 tabs; Global, Parameters and Curves.

GlobalGeneral information contained within the XML file is detailed.Filenameand path, relatedFileIDandDatadepthparameters are all included. You may enter information on the authors or suppliers of the XML file in the field markedVendorname. The vendor name will appear in the Curve Data History.StartandEndDepthsare filled in automatically as is theSamplingmode,DepthIncrement,Unitsand theFileNamingSystem.The table window near the bottom of the dialog box contains the XML Tags and their corresponding XML value. The XML Tag is taken from the original data set. The information displayed here can be compared to the Well Information section of a LAS file.The Tag is essentially the title of the data, for example Well Name would be a common tag to appear here. You then get the opportunity to supply amnemonicto this tag. The mnemonic used in the ODF can then be assigned to this tag and the XML value for that tag can therefore be applied to the specified mnemonic.

ParametersThis table displays Parameter-Mnemonic information from the WellLogML file: the mnemonic, its Unit, Description and Value.

CurvesInformation on the curves that you wish to load are displayed here. TheCurve Mnemonic,Unit,NameandDescriptionalong withNullValueare listed for each curve within the XML file.The last column,Load?, gives you the opportunity to deselect any curves that you do not wish to load. By default all curves within the XML file will be loaded. To deselect a curve, click the cell in the Load column for that curve (row) and type ‘N’. Type the letter ‘Y’ for yes if you decide to again load the curve.

SelectApplyto save any changes, thenOKto load.



GEO accepts curve data in ascii (space, comma and tab delimited), Las and XML format.

On theGEOtab, selectImport.

In theOpendialog box, theFiles of Typebox lists the curve data types accepted. Select the type required.

Locate and select the curve data file, then clickOpen.Step 1 of the Data Import Wizard will invoke.

The curve dataTypewill be automatically detected.

Select theData Source Typeand theData Type. This allows the curves to be grouped.

SelectNext. Step 2 of the Data Import Wizard will open.

Enter the data range to be loaded in theFromandToboxes.

Specify the Null (or pen-up) data values in theUse as Null data Value.The default is -999.25. If the data vendor has used a different value e.g. -999.99 define it here.

By default,Treat Null data value as “empty”will be cleared. In which case, GEO will ‘pen-up’ when it encounters null values within a curve. The curve will be discontinuous over any null intervals.SelectTreat Null data value as “empty”to draw a continuous curve. When a null value is encountered the curve will connect the previous valid value with the next valid value.

Edit the curveName,Mnemonic,Synonym,UnitsandTypeas required.

Elect to not load certain data by clicking on the column header. Or use theSelect AllorDeselect Allbuttons. Selected data will be black and deselected data will be red.If a mnemonic is not formatted in the curve default ini file, it will be blue.

ClickFinishto complete the wizard.





In a space-delimited ASCII data file, cells in a column are separated from the next, by one or more spaces.As the number of the spaces may not be constant between columns, the width of each column needs to be explicitly specified.Note. It is very important to have the curve mnemonic, unit and data for each curve to lie within successive columns, and for the first row of data to be the curve mnemonic (column name).In theStep 1 of the Data Import Wizard, adjust the column widths manually.

Ensure that the first row of the data file is fixed as the Curve Mnemonics (column names), by scrolling the data, as required, until the curve mnemonics are central within the text box field.

ClickSet 1st Heading Lineto obscure any spurious leading data such as well name, run number, etc. from GEO. (Remember to instruct the data provider NOT to include such content on the next file provided).

Click anywhere in a data column to select its separator (vertical line), such that the separator color turns from black to red.

Click theMove selected Column edgeplus and minus buttons to move the separator to the right and left respectively.Note. Moving a column separator causes all other separators to the right of it to move by the same amount.

Align the separator hard against the right edge of the data column, leaving no spaces.

Repeat steps 3 to 6 for each column that requires realignment of the separator.

ClickOKto close the File Viewdialog box.

It is highly recommended that you scroll through the entire file to ensure the correct positioning of all column separators.Ensure that the last entry in the file is the last row of data values, and not other spurious information.

The qualitative track allows you to easily record and display a range of depth related values. Examples include shows, porosity, grain-size and sorting.

Geo provides a visual indication of these values and builds the information into a database. This means that at any point the data is easily accessible for export.

Histogram or Differential

The histogram type might be used to present porosity. If you click in a cell allocated ‘Good’ porosity, the cells to the left (Fair and Poor) would automatically be filled.

The differential type track does not automatically fill all cells to the left of the cell that is clicked. For this reason, you can record from one cell through to the maximum number of available cells at any one depth. The differential style might be used to present grain size where, if you click inside the ‘Coarse’ cell for instance, this does not mean that sample automatically has medium and fine characteristics.

To set up a Qualitative track:

Create a qualitative track –see creating a presentation or track.

On theEditmenu, selectTrackSettings. The Track Settings dialog box will open.

Select the qualitative track.

SelectDetails. The Qualitative Track Information dialog box will open. Here you can set up the qualitative track parameters based on the type of information you wish to record.

Enter sampling interval in the Logging Frequency (for example 5ft).

ChooseDisplay Logging frequency lines.

Choose toDisplay Horizontal Track Grids.

The layout feature can be used to organize and display data in several different formats (composite log, lithology log, wireline log, etc.) all within one file.

If adding a layout to a new ‘blank’ session of GEO,Load an existing Vew fileorcreate a new one.

If adding a layout to an odf with layouts already defined, create the layout first (step 1-2) – it will create a copy of the layout currently opened – the contents can then be overwritten byloading a view fileorcreate a new oneby editing the existing tracks.

On theHometab, open the layout drop box, scroll to the bottom of the list, and select<Create Layout…>. The Create Layout dialog box will open.

Enter a layout name and selectOK. The layout will now be listed in the layout drop box.

On theHometab, open the layout drop box, scroll to the bottom of the list, and select<Create Layout…>. The Create Layout dialog box will open.

Enter a layout name and selectOK. The second layout will now be listed in the layout drop box.  A tick will appear next to the name of the layout that is actively displayed.

Up to 19 layouts can be created in one ODF file.

Note. Only once a new View file of track settings has been created is the layout named.

The name of the actively displayed layout will also appear in the quick access toolbar.

Toggle between layouts using the drop box on the Home menu or in the quick access toolbar.



Use the following procedure to create a new track format.

This can be saved as a View file which can be imported into other ODF or ODT files.

Determine the width of the plot presentation (usually based on the paper size to print it) and the width of each track (either in inches or millimeters).

Determine the track type for each track; Depth, Linear, Logarithmic, Lithology, % Lithology, Text and Qualitative. For each logarithmic type, establish the number of log cycles and what should be the start number (1 to 9) or the log cycle.

On theEdittab, selectTrackSettings. The Track Settings dialog box will open.

On theMaintab, click number 0 and enter aTrackName.An example setup for a database (allowing toggling between Lithology Log and Composite Log layouts) might be:Track 0 as Depth trackTrack 3 as Lithology (interpreted) trackTrack 5 as Correlation (Linear) track (for ROP, GR, SP)Track 7 as Chromatograph Gas (Logarithmic) trackTrack 16 as Wireline Resistivity (Logarithmic) track (for ILM and ILD)Track 23 as Lithology Descriptions (Text) track.Track 32 as Shows (Qualitative) track.

SelectDisplayTrackturn on its display.

Enter the trackLeftPositionandRightPosition.

The following step is dependent on the track type selected.

Enter the number ofVertical Grid LinesandVert. Major Every.

You have the option to define a grid value which restricts the depth of drawn lithology to multiples of that value. SelectSnap toGridand enter aGrid Value.

Enter theLogCyclesandLogCycleStart.

The Global Settings - which control the scale and log appearance attributes - can be accessed by selectingGlobalSettingson theEdittab.

The Global Settings content will change depending on if your log is plotted against depth or time.

The following information is for logs plotted against Date Time.

Date Time Range & Zooms Tab

Plot Date and TimefromandTo- Enter the from and to values that determine the date time range of the log displayed on screen and also in print.Setting these values to the bounds of the date time range you want to display or print does NOT of course remove from the ODF database any stored data for the range outside of the bounds you have set. The active View settings are merely altered (until reset) to limit the scrollable or printable section of log to that date time range specified.

Date Time Track Display Attributes

Display Date Every- Check to display the date everyMidnight,MonthorNoneby checking appropriate radio button.The corresponding midnight/month time entry can be made to display on the line below the Date by checking theDisplay Time On a New Linecheck box.

Font- Select the font of the date time values.

DateFormatandTimeFormat- Define the date and time format. A preview of the format will display on the far right.

Use Date Time format for Table- Check to use the Date and Time Format defined above for Date and Time table columns.

Track Edge- Define the thickness of the logs track edges.Normalis the same width as minor grids,Mediumis slightly thicker andWideare the thickest.Note.The actual appearance ofNormal,MediumandWidewidths are defined by the settings inDisplayPenWidthsin theOptionsdialog box (on theEdittab).

Center Line or Log Decade- Define the thickness of the center line of the linear tracks or log decade lines on the logarithmic tracks. SelectNormalto make them the same thickness as the minor grids andMediummake them thicker than the minor grids.Note.The actual appearance ofNormal andMediumwidths are defined by the settings inDisplayPenWidthsin theOptionsdialog box (on theEdittab).

Vertical Grid- customize the color of vertical grid lines.

Vertical Micro Grid (Log)

Color- Choose the color of the mirco grid of logarithmic tracks.

SolidorDashedLineradio buttons -  Choose the micro grids to be solid or dashed.

DisplayXandY- Set the Display (screen) zoom.

PrintXandY- Set the Print zoom.Note. The default value of 1 is 100% zoom. To increase the zoom enter a value greater than 1. To reduce the zoom, enter a value less than 1.Note. The X (width of the plot) and Y (length of the plot) zooms can be altered independently. To maintain an aspect ratio, keep them the same.Tip. If you increase or decrease thePrintZoomfactor (for both X and Y), the plot scale needs to be increased or decreased by the same factor in order to maintain the correct scale in the print. For example, if applying a 1.5 Print X and Y to a 1 : 60 minute log, the scale should be adjusted to 1 : 90.

Horizontal Tracktext Font Scaling- When the plot scale changes, it can cause horizontal text entries (normally descriptions) to overlap and become cut off, preventing the whole text entry from being viewed. To prevent this, use the following controls to resize the text when the scale changes.

Current Scale Factor- Displays the factor by which the horizontal track text has been reduced to compensate for the changed scale.

Compute whenever Plot Scale changes- Check to automatically change the text font size when the scale changes.

Vertical Track Text Font Scale- When the plot scale changes, it can cause vertical track text entries (normally the chrono and litho stratigraphy) to overlap. To prevent this, enter the factor by which the vertical track text has to be reduced to compensate for the changed scale.

This tab controls scale and date-time settings.

Select a Scale Setting-From the drop list, select a predefined scale or use the boxes below to define a new scale.

Screen Units- Set the screen units toInches(imperial) orMillimeters(metric).Note. Since all physical measurement in the log is done in either of those two units, any screen unit value used by GEO for log configuration, will be altered to this chosen unit. This includes the mouse co-ordinate values on the status bar, the track edge positions, as well as headers positions.

IndexUnits- Set toHours,MinutesorSeconds. Each option has a list of pre-set scale settings in the Select a Scale Setting list.

Date Values- Enter the frequency at which the date values display on the Date Time track.

By default, this is set to 20 minutes.At each set time interval, GEO will save a copy of your work-to-date to back-up file in the default or specified Back-up Directory.Should GEO or your system abnormally terminate (due to power failure or program crash), you will only lose data that changed since the last auto-save.You will be presented with the option of re-loading your work from the back-up file on re-launching a session of GEO. On normal termination of the application, the Back-up directory is flushed (deleted), ready for the next session.Note. If the value entered in this box is too small, it may cause inconvenience by frequent interruptions while the software creates a backup, especially when the file is large. On the other hand, if the set time is too large, you may encounter a higher risk of losing more of your work, if the system terminates abnormally.Warning. Do not use this AutoSave feature as the only means of backup for you file. Always manually backup your ODF file to a different media or place or storage.

Setting of Wrap Curves- When a curve that is plotted on a track has a value, which falls outside the scale range assigned for that curve, you may wish to wrap the curve around (i.e. to present the back-up curves). Set the following attributes for wrapped curves.

The Global Settings - which control the scale and log appearance attributes - can be accessed by selectingGlobalSettingson theEdittab.

The Global Settings content will change depending on if your log is plotted against depth or time.

The following information is for logs plotted against Depth.

Depth Range and Zooms Tab

The first tab in global settings is theDepth Range & Zoomstab.

Plot Depths fromandto- Define the depth range of the log displayed on screen and also in print.Note. Setting these values to the bounds of the depth range you want to display or print does NOT of course remove from the ODF database, any stored data for the range outside of the bounds you have set. The active view settings are merely altered (until reset) to limit the scrollable or printable section of log to that depth range specified.Note. If you specify thePlot Depths Fromas 0, when a data set starting from 1000 ft is loaded, the plot will start from 1000 ft, instead of 0 ft. However, if thePlot Depths Fromis greater than 0 ft (but less than 1000 ft), the plot will start from this specified depth, when the same data set (also started from 1000 ft) is loaded.

PrimaryandAlternate Depth Display Attributes- You can display up to two depth systems on the plot; aPrimaryandAlternatedepth system.

A template file (.ODT file) can be generated from anODFfile using the template building wizard.

Creating a template from an approved final log ODF, preserves a standard format that can be used for future wells. It will contain the library information (headers, lithology, modifiers, structures and symbols) and view file contents (track layout information, depth and screen units, scale and pen information (optional)). The wizard allows users to include or omit further plot elements from an existing ODF.

Run a blank session of GEO and from theGEOmenu selectTemplate, thenCreate. The Open dialog box will open.

Select the ODF you would like to generate a template from and clickOpen. The wizard will open.The wizard lists all the information stored in the ODF.TheItemTypeslists the log elements that may be excluded from the ODT.TheItemDetailsfield lists the information in the ODF relating to each of theItem Types. If theItem Detailsfield is empty, there is no information in the ODF relating to thatItem Type.

By default, all items within the ODF are automatically included when building an template. However, you can choose whichItemDetailsto exclude. UseExcludeandIncludeto control the selected items presence in the template. The wizard will then move on to the nextItemType.Note. If you plan to include every Item, on entering the wizard clickSaveAsTemplate- all items will automatically be included and you will skip straight to saving the template.Note. From theItemDetailsfield, rather than excluding or including all details, individual or multiple rows can be selected and included or excluded.Note.

To maximize the viewing potential of your logs it is possible to divide the main GEO window into two horizontal sections. This allows you to view two totally separate areas of the plot. This may be beneficial if you wish to compare two sections of your well log that are hundreds of feet/meters apart. It is also possible to retain a header or trailer table data in one section whilst looking at the plot where that information refers.

To apply this feature:

At the top of the main Vertical scroll bar on the right hand side of the window is a small gray bar, directly above the ‘up’ arrow.

ClickandHoldwith the left mouse button.

Dragdown towards the middle of the screen.

Releasethe mouse button.

The screen will now divide intwo.

Two separate scroll bars will now appear, allowing you in each section to view any part of the log you wish.

To return the screen to just one whole section, simply click and hold the bar as before and drag it to the position above the top ‘up’ arrow.

Tip.You can also perform this same operation via theViewtab, by selecting theCreate/CloseSplitWindow.

Tip. To split the screen so that the track legend automatically freezes on the top half of the screen, on theViewtab clickFreeze Legend Pane.



GEO is launched using any of the following methods;

Click the program icon (GEO for Windows) in the Windows menu.Note. The GEO icon may not appear in the Start menu anymore, when you do a fresh installation of this current version of GEO.

Import from ASCII file

On theLithologytab, selectImport %Lithology. The Import % Lithology will open.

Locate and select the percent lithology file you wish to import andOpen. TheGEO-%Litho–Select Trackdialog box will open.Note. The ASCII file you are loading must follow a specific format to be accepted by GEO. These are detailed in the 'Create ASCII file of percent lithology data for import into GEO' below.

InSelectTrack, choose the percent lithology track.

SelectEditto choose your preferred lithology options for the ten columns and clickOK.

ClickOKto import the data.

Note. The data in this example is separated by a tab space.All percentage values must add up to 100% for each row.The lithology spellings must match those in the odf.

In GEO, double click on the percent Lithology track, or on theLithologytab select the% Lithologytrack. The Percentage Lithology Information box will open.

SelectImport. Any issues with the data format will be flagged here - please read the information carefully to learn how to correct any errors.

Create ASCII file of percent lithology data for import into GEO

To import percent lithology data into GEO, the following rules must be followed,

The file should be in Text-comma separated (CSV file) or Text-tab delimited file (TXT file) format.

The first value of each line must be the depth.

The depth values in subsequent lines must be ascending (deeper values).

Following the depth value there should be 10 subsequent values each representing the % number for each of the ten (10) lithology columns.

These 10 percentage values must add up to 100% for each row.

Note. Although you have a percent Lithology track in the log, an error message similar to 'no-Percentage-Litho Track available' may appear when you clickImport%Lithologyon theLithologytab.

This error message is caused by the presence of %litho data in that track. You can only import percent lithology data into anemptypercent lithology track.

If the error message occurs,

Double click on the %Lithology track to open the Percentage Lithology Information box.

Clear theIn Usecheck box to delete all data in that track.

ClickYesto confirm the deletion, then clickUpdate& Exit.

Now, you can import the percent lithology file by clickingImport %Lithologyon theLithologytab.

There are two types of qualitative tracks;histogramanddifferential.

Thehistogramtype might be used to present porosity. If you click in a cell allocated ‘Good’ porosity, the cells to the left (Fair and Poor) would automatically be filled.

Thedifferentialtype track does not automatically fill all cells to the left of the cell that is clicked. For this reason, you can record from one cell through to the maximum number of available cells at any one depth. The differential style might be used to present grain size where, if you click inside the ‘Coarse’ cell for instance, this does not mean that sample automatically has medium and fine characteristics.

To enter histogram or differential data;

Left click to fill a cell. For differential histogram, the color which paints will be the first option (first row) defined in the Differential Color on grid of the Qualitative Track information dialog box. To paint the next color option in the grid (second row), left click on the same cell a second time. To paint the third option, left click on the cell a third time and so on, working through the color options from top to bottom.

Right click on a filled cell, to empty it.

To fill multiple cells, hold the left mouse buttons down and drag over the cells in a downward motion.

Configuring an ODF to be opened by e-View is the most efficient and cost effective way of sharing your data. Our free viewer, GEOe-View can be downloaded from our websitewww.geologix.com/eview.

Warning.When an ODF becomes e-View enabled anyone with a copy of e-View can potentially open the file, thus as default all ODF's are e-view disabled.

To e-View Enable an Document

Open the required ODF/ODT

On theEdittab, selectGlobalSettings. The Global Settings dialog box will open.

On theOthertab, check theAllow this Document to be opened by Geo e-View(middle of dialog box).

To disable the document, clear this box.

Your document is now e-View enabled. You can quickly check this by returning to the main GEO window, where at the right hand side of the status bar ‘e-View Enabled’ will be highlighted in light blue. Adversely when the document is not configured to be viewed by e-View, ‘e-View Disabled’ will appear in gray.

Tip.You can quickly enable an ODF to be viewed by e-View by right clicking on the above text on the status bar and selecting ‘e-View Enabled’. To disable an ODF, right-click again and select ‘e-View Disabled’.

It is possible to change the default setting so that all documents are automatically e-View enabled.

On theEdittab, selectEditGEOSettings. TheGEO Registry Editorwill open.

On theGeneraltab, check theAllow New ODFs to be Opened by GEOeViewby default(middle right).

Of course you can disable and enable individual documents as you please using the option inGlobalSettings.



The Event log records important episodes in the life of an ODF file.

File saving, curve editing and loading episodes are all recorded in theView Event Login Descending Chronological orderdialog box. This can be invoked by selectingView Event Logfrom theGEOtab.

Events are listed in a chronological order, applying a date and time stamp for each. The following are included in the event log:

Log on as a new user name

Depth shift the curves

Note. A new save event would not be created every time you save the ODF file. If one user saved a file multiple times in one day, only one save event would be recorded. The date and time field would simply update and record the most recent time saved. The next day however, the first save would invoke a new file save event. If multiple users saved files multiple times in one day, a save event would be recorded for each user detailing the most recent time saved.

The event log details the following information.

Startandenddata depth (relating to the data load event).

The name of theUserwho logged on to the software at the time of the ‘event’.

Dateandtimeof the ‘event’.

TheErrorcolumn that details any GEO error ‘message number’ should an error occur during a file load or save episode. If no error occurs this value will show zero.

Description. This information depends on the ‘event’. If it were a file load episode for example, the description would detail the ‘Number of data columns that were loaded’, ‘File path’, ‘File name’, ‘GEO license number’ and whether the curves were appended. Relating to a file save, the description will detail the directory saved to and the file name.

ClickPrintto print the event log using the printer that you have setup through thePrint Setup.

Note. The user can resize this dialog box, as well as the widths of the data-table columns. The next time this dialog box is invoked, it will use the last-sized width (also the data-table columns).



To jump or go to a certain place on your log (eitherDepthorTime, depends on the definedPlot Index), on theDepthtab selectIndexConvertor, or press <CTRL>+<HOME> on your keyboard.

This will open the Convert Index dialog box.

Enter the depth or time of the section of log you wish to view and clickGo to.

This will instantly display the relevant depth section and so eradicates the need to scroll through large expanses of log.

Tip. Placing your mouse cursor over the scroll-button and then left-clicking and holding, invokes a tool-tip showing the depth currently at the top of the on-screen log. Dragging the button up or down changes the depth within the tool-tip.

Release the left-mouse button at the required depth, and the on-screen log will re-draw with the selected depth at the top of the screen.



In order to preserve secrecy on any work that you do within GEO, it is possible for you to setpasswordprotection on your files. There are three levels of protection you can apply to a document: Update, View / Print and Export.

When attempting to access a document that is password protected you will be faced with a drop down option box and a text box.

SelectFile, thenOpen/Importto locate the desired document.

Click on the small arrow at the end of the drop down option box.

SelectUpdate,View / PrintorExport.

In the box below type in the password for the appropriate selection.

Note. ClickingCancelwill result in the appearance of a warning message and termination of the GEO program.

Once access is granted you may perform the relevant modifications or actions dependent on the access level you have reached. Any option that is ‘grayed’ out will not be available on the current level of access.

Note.Passwords arenotcase sensitive.



ODF files can be password protected should the content of the file be of a confidential nature, and/or you want to prevent certain recipients of the file from modifying or updating its content.

Use the following procedure to password your file.

On theDefinetab, selectPasswords. TheSpecify Access for Documentwill open.

From theSelect Desired Accesslist, select theUpdateaccess level.

In theEnter Password for Access,typethe chosen password.

Re-confirm the password in theRe-enter Passwordbox.Note. The password isnotcase sensitive and its maximum length is 15 characters.

Repeat this process for theView / PrintandExportaccess level listed in theSelect desired Accessbox.

Note. Remember to keep a record of your chosen password(s) in a secure place, as once password protected you will not be able to open the ODF, or change/remove password protection without the correctUpdatelevel password.

Next time the ODF file is saved, the password protection will be implemented at the chosen access level.

Each time the ODF file is opened thereafter, the appropriate password must be entered for the required access level.

Notes.You cannot apply a password forView / Printaccess, without first applying a password forUpdateaccess.

Password protection can be removed/changed only by opening the ODF with theUpdateaccess level password, and then deleting the entries in the password fields. You must delete theView / Printaccess password first, before attempting to remove the password forUpdateaccess.

Tip. If a password forUpdateaccess has been applied to an ODF, you basically send it as a ‘Read-Only’ file to another party (or simply like a picture). The other party will not have any access to the data that builds this ODF, unless they are separately provided with the appropriate password.



All of the object links (to further or additional information on these objects) in GEO can be viewed and modified in theView or Modify All External and Internal Linksdialog box (on theToolstab, selectLinks).

The object type where the link is assigned, such as symbol, lithology, text.

The sequential number of the linking process, i.e. which object is linked first, second etc.

The location and file name of the link.

The name of the header or trailer specification, which is linked to that particular object.

Note. In the case of anInternal Link(i.e. link with header or trailer specifications within the plot), select the appropriate option button and select the correct specification.

Tip.TheCreate or Modify External and InternalLinks for an Objectdialog box can be also invoked by right-clicking any object (such as a symbol, modifier, line, free-format text, track-text block or lithology unit) and clickingCreate/Modify Linkfrom the menu.

Note. The user can resize this dialog box, as well as the widths of the data-table columns.The next time this dialog box is invoked, it will use the last-sized width (also the data-table columns).

You can provide additional information for log elements (such as lithology units, modifiers, symbols, free format text and track text blocks) by linking those objects, at any instance within the log, with another file (e.g. a morning-report that is written in MS WordÔformat).

When viewing the log (ODF) within a web browser (such as Internet ExplorerÔ), the link feature will allow the user to click an object and read any further information that is linked to it.

This allows you to create ‘hyperlinks’ as they are widely deployed throughout the internet or on intranets, without any prior knowledge of the web-based Hyper-Text Markup Language [HTML].

In GEO, an object can have anExternalLink, anInternalLink, orboth.

Typically an External Link could point to a Universal Resource Locator [URL] (on the Internet or Intranet) or Network location that provides more information about one of the above objects.

This information is not stored in the document, only a link to the information is stored.

The Link could point to a Web page, a picture or other document.

For example a Core symbol could point to a URL that has an actual picture of the core section stored on the Intranet or Internet.

This allows information to be stored at the most appropriate location, where it can be kept up-to-date and easily viewed from the Link in your document.

An Internal Link can be used to associate a Header or Trailer specifications with a lithology, symbol or free format text occurrence.

Learn how to add a header or trailer to your log.

Create or Modify links

Right-click the object on the log that you want to link to another report (or photograph, etc.).

ClickCreate/Modify Linkfrom the menu. TheCreate or Modify External and Internal Links for an Objectdialog box will open.

Create or modify anExternal Linkby typing in the desired URL or using theBrowsebutton to locate a local or network file.

Create or modify anInternal Linkby selecting the corresponding header or trailer option button and selecting the appropriate specification.

Tip.  Alternatively, clickingLinksfrom the properties dialog box of each object also allows you to create or modify the links.

This option allows you to truncate any file path relative to the location of the actual log you are linking the object too. If the file path of the linked document is the same as the log then the path will be truncated to ‘.\Core Data.doc’ for example, denoting its location as the same as the log itself.

Left clear, the file path will be displayed in UNC (Universal Naming Convention).

If an object has an Internal or External Link, its location is displayed in a tool tip when the mouse pointer is over the object.

You can open that external link by right-clicking the object and clickingOpen External Linkfrom the menu. This should invoke your web browser for a Web URL, or an application associated with whatever the external link references (for example, a link to a file with a .doc extension would normally open MS WordÔ, if this application is present on the viewing-user’s computer or network).

For an internal link, clickGoafter right-clicking the object, to bring the referenced header or trailer into view.

You can select a more obvious indicator that a link exists by selecting a mark from the drop down list at the bottom of the dialog box. The adjacent drop down list the positions you can display your marker. To remove an unwanted marker, simply set the marker to the blank option at the top of the list.

TheIn Useoption is automatically checked when you create a link, defining the link as active. In order to delete a link, clear this option, the link will then be deleted.

Additional Information

ODF viewers like GEOView and GEOe-View do not have context menus for objects (i.e. you cannot right-click the object).

However, if an object has a link, this is displayed as a tool tip when the mouse pointer is above it, and the mouse pointer should change to the pointing-hand form, indicating the presence of the link.

In addition, double-clicking on the object will bring an Internal Link into view or invoke the appropriate action for an External Link.

If the object hasbothan Internal and an External Link, a context menu will display to allow selection of the appropriate link.

SVG output also contains External link information and may be viewed by double clicking the object.

If an object has a link, when the mouse pointer is brought over the object in the SVG display, the mouse pointer should also change to a hand pointer and display link information in the status bar of the Web browser.

Learn how to export the plot to SVG format.



You can now export and import yourINI files,Geological Dictionary,Training CardandExport profiles,so they can be quickly and easily shared with colleagues and partners.

On the theToolstab, selectBaggage.TheManage Baggage Filesdialog box will open. It is split into seven sections.

For each section you canLoadorExport. By default the INI files will always be included within a template, plus when you start a new ODF from scratch, you will automatically use the default INI file on your machine.

Warning. When you open up an ODF or ODT it is a good idea to assume the INI files are exclusive to that document so please Load and Export your INI files with care, as they can cause major changes to a document.

In order to load a file into a template or ODF click theLoadbutton. This will open theLoaddialog box. Here you can choose the file you wish to use.

You can give your files a custom name, however theGeoTable,GeoCurveandGeoCCini files with regards to their content do still exclusively apply to that area of GEO only.



Some of the information used to create a composite log may need to be cataloged in other systems such as the corporate geological database.

Therefore, there should be a means to export data captured by GEO (and encapsulated in the ODF) to the other system.

There are a couple of ways to do this.

To export all other data, except for the curve data, using theExport All Informationfeature. This is explained below.

Note.To export the curve data to LAS, Text-tab delimited or Comma-tab delimited format, please use theExport Curve Datafeature

Export All Information

This feature allows you to select specific ODF components (or objects) to be exported from GEO, since not all objects in an ODF may need to be exported.

For example, although a box around text is a symbol, it has no relevance to geology. Similarly, in a long sequence the age-dating column may have the word JURASSIC repeated several times. Only one of the text blocks signifies the correct interval. This dialog box shows total number of the items in an ODF file and allows you to choose what to be exported from GEO.

Use the following procedure to export the data from GEO through an intermediary text-form file:

Open the ODF containing the data to be exported.

On theExporttab selectAllInfo. The Select Items to Export will open.

Objects with the check box selected will be exported. If youdo notwant to export an object, clear the check box.

At each object, you will see the total number of that item in the ODF and the number of selected elements to be exported. By default, all total numbers will be exported.

ClickingSelectat each item brings up the items’ list, allowing you to select a particular item of that object to be exported. The total number of the selected items of each object will be written under theSelectedcolumn.

ClickExport. TheExportAsdialog box will open.

Enter aFile nameand select a folder to save to.

ClickSaveto start exporting the selected objects from GEO.

The ‘logical block’ of the text (TXT) file as theExport All Inforesult is shown below.

A semicolon (";") as the first token in a line denotes a comment-line, which has been inserted only for the purpose of readability.

Each block begins with a BEGIN keyword, followed by the type of the block; a block always ends with an END keyword.

The Global block is always the first block in the file.

The depth values will always be represented in the fixed-point notation.

The mnemonic-name will always be four characters long.

The symbol-type, modifier-type and litho-type will be the (up to) eight-character names as they appear in GEO.

The free-format text and track text field will consist of a text-length field followed by a ":" character and then the text-value. A single <CR> character denotes a new-line.

Here is an example of the ‘logical block’ format of a TXT file, as amExport All Inforesult.

depth.units Feet | Meters

depth.range <start-depth> <end-depth>

; NOTE: Several 'Table' blocks are possible!!

BEGIN Table <table-name> <table-id>

<depth>  <symbol-type> <*field-name> <*field-value>

<mnemonic-name>  <*description> <*value> [<units>]

<depth>   length:<*text>

<symbol-type>  <depth> [<end-depth>]

<litho-type> <start-depth> <end-depth>

<modifier-type> <depth> [<litho-type>]

<depth>   <length>:<*text>

<start-depth> <end-depth>  <*text>



You can export the complete set of library and baggage components from within an ODF or ODT. This can be used for the sharing of your library, or for checking the content of an ODT when in construction.

On theToolstab, selectExportLibrary. The Browse For Folder dialog box will open.

Select a location to export to.

SelectMakeNewFolderand enter a suitable name.

Tip. To input library files into another ODF/ODT, use the multi-file load feature - on theToolstab, selectLibraryTools(this opens the Library Manager)and select the relevant category radio button. I.e. Symbols, Lithology etc. Browse to the file, select it and clickOpen.



This feature allows curve data to be exported from GEO in three different ASCII formats:

Text Tab-delimited ASCII file

Text Comma-delimited ASCII file

For full flexibility a fourth format is also available

XML (extensible Markup Language) format.

The curves present within the ODF will be listed in theSelect Curves to Exportsection (on theExporttab, selectExportCurve(s)).

The list details the following.

The curve number will be displayed here.

An asterisk denotes that a curve is displayed on the plot

The mnemonic of the curve (usually an abbreviation of the curve name).

The Full name of the curve.

A decimal number denoting the sampling frequency of the data. ‘Variable’ denotes a mixed sampling frequency.

The start depth of the curve data.

End depth of the curve data.

The lowest value of curve data.

The highest value of curve data.

Name of the original data set defined during loading.

To export curve data from GEO

On theExporttab, selectExport Curve(s). TheExport Curve Datadialog box will open.

Select the format that you want the curve data to be exported inExport Format.

Select the curves that you want to export. Any asterisk (*) after the number indicates that the curves are displayed on the plot.

Type the depth range of the curve to be exported in theStartandEndboxes.

Define theNullvaluesof exported data. The default (API Standard) is –999.25.

The source of parameter and well mnemonics that will appear in theParameterInformationandWellInformationsection (at LAS format) can be specified in theParameterInformationfromandWellInformationfrom.Note. You can only export curve data into LAS format, if all the curve data has the same sampling interval and data depth range. Otherwise, it will only export data for depths that occur in all selected curves.

ClickExport. AnExport To Text Asdialog box will open.

Type the exportedFilename, and select the folder it will save to.

Note. Use any text editor (such as NotepadÔto see the exported data).

Note. TheCopylistto Clipboard buttonallows you to copy the list of curve data in the dialog box onto the clipboard. This allows you to acquire a summary of the curve diagnostics with the benefit of being able to export them into other applications.

The summary includes information on curve Number, Mnemonic, Name, the Interval (Feet), Start Depth, End Depth, Minimum and Maximum values, Units and the file Origin.

XML(eXtensible Markup Language) is a platform-independent meta-markup language that provides a format for describing structured data.

XML provides a structural representation of data that has proved broadly implementable and easy to deploy across all platforms.

The specifications of XML have been laid down by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C, seewww.w3c.orgfor details), an international consortium founded in 1994 to develop standards for the Web.

WellLogMLis an XML standard adopted by the Petrotechnical Open Software Corporation (POSC) to exchange well log data (seewww.posc.org/ebiz/WellLogML). SDC Geologix is a full member of POSC and collaborates in the development of these standards.

WellLogML is a system for encoding well information for the Web that is flexible and extensible, suitable for interaction with external software on any platform.

WellLogML is similar to LAS, in that it specifies how well log data is organized in terms of Well Information, Curve Information, Parameter Information, etc.

Export Curve Data as XML

On theExporttab, selectExportCurves. The Export Curve Data dialog box will open.

InExportFormat, selectXML.

Select one or more curves to exportNote. These curves MUST have the same depth interval.

Change theStartDepth,EndDepthandNullValueif necessary.

Choose the appropriate value for theParameter Information fromand theWell Information from.

ClickExport, choose a folder and file-name to export to and clickSave.



WitsML is an information transfer standard based on XML technology that has no set platform and is language independent, making it wholly flexible for the range of data that can be attained from a well.

There are six types of data you may export from an ODF/ODT:

encapsulates Geological information such as Gas data, descriptions, lithology, % lithology, table/curve parameter details and now qualitative information.

Exclusively deals with casing/borehole table data.

Collects survey data.

Deals with sequence/formation top table data.

Usedto export data related to the BHA and drillstring.

Deals with curve data, a single Log object can harbor multiple curves.

If you have the export modules as part of your GEO Licence you can access the Export wizard from theExporttab, and selectCreate Text Output Profile.

There are multiple options for the conversion of your plot into an image format.

Metafiles are essentially a way of intelligently storing pictorial information and provide a useful means of transferring plots to other applications.

Their main advantage is that in general, they are far less prone to distortion when scaled than bitmaps. This is because in a metafile, shapes can be defined as a mathematical formula rather than as a conglomeration of dots.

The other advantage is that a metafile usually requires less disk space than a corresponding bitmap.

You can export the complete plot, or any section of it, to the following formats.

Export Plot as an Image

Note. The default path for these exported files depends on the type of metafile output selected.

The default path for WMF and CGM are defined at theFileLocationstab in theRegistryEditordialog box (opened by selectingEditGEOSettingsfrom theEdittab) and can be changed, as required.

Important.Prior to exporting to a metafile, select a suitable printer device from the print setup dialog box.

GEO will use the device driver to obtain the horizontal resolution (pixels per inch), vertical resolution (pixels per inch), page size (pixels) and text formatting information.

We recommend you install a suitable printer driver for just this purpose, as our experience has shown that certain printer-drivers are poor at creating metafiles.

We recommend use of the printer-driver for the EPSON STYLUS 1520 COLORÔprinter for optimum metafile creation.



The CGM (Computer Graphic Metafile) format can be used to transfer a plot to a large plotter (e.g. HP DesignJetÔ) through CGM interpreter software (such as Zeh GraphicsÔor SDIÔsoftware).

One reason for doing so is to circumvent the length limitation (109 inches) of certain printer-drivers operating under WindowsÔ. This limitation does not of course arise when plotting under the UNIX platform.

GEO can export to CGM files with either 16 or 32-bit precision.

The 16-bit CGM complies with ISO-8362 binary specifications and may not be able to cope with very long plots.

The 32-bit CGM, on the other hand, is equipped to handle any length of plot and is compatible with PIP (Petroleum Information Profile).

On theEdittab, selectHeadersandTrailers. The Plot Header and Trailer Specificationsdialog box will open.Tip.If a trailer component such as a spreadsheet was loaded with theOLE objectcheck box selected, you can remove the OLE object with the following simple procedure.

Double-click that spreadsheet in the trailer in GEO to open it in the native application (perhaps MS ExcelÔ).

Copy it to the clipboard and load it back atthe Plot Header and Trailer Specificationsdialog box, with the same name, but this time ensure theOLE objectcheck box isclear (no tick).

On theEdittab, selectEditGEOSettings. The Registry Editor dialog box will open.

Open theCGMAdvancedtab and check the settings.Note. The defaults are usually good in most cases.

On theExporttab, selectExportas...thenCGM. TheExport to CGM (32 bit)will open.

Enter theFilenameand specify the path to save to.

For output to the plotter, such as the HP DesignJetÔseries transfer the corresponding CGM format and its parameter file (with par extension) to the plotter by using FTP (File Transfer Protocol) to the UNIX platform.



EMF (Enhanced Meta File) may sometimes be more preferable than WMF format, since EMF format is able to cope with alonger plotthan WMF.

Therefore it may be advisable to export a particular section of your plot intoEMF-Enhanced Metafile to clipboardand paste it to MS PowerPointÔfor presentation purposes.

Export a section of plot to EMF

On theDepthtab, enter the Index Range you wish to export inFromandTo.

On theExporttab, selectExportas...then eitherEMF-Enhanced MetafileorEMF-Enhanced Metafile to clipboard.

AnExportTodialog box will open (unless you selectEMF-Metafile picture to clipboard).  Enter aFilenameand the directory where it is going to be stored.

The following video selects WMF as the format to export. Simply replace this selection with EMF.



Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an open standard vector graphics language.

It is XML-based and can be used for Web graphics.

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) maintains the SVG specification.

On theDepthtab, enter the Index Range you wish to export inFromandTo.

On theExporttab, selectExportas...thenSVG - Scaleable Vector Graphics.

AnExportTodialog box will open.  Enter aFilenameand the directory where it is going to be stored.

The following video selects WMF as the export format. Simply replace this selection with SVG.

The resulting XML file (with extension .SVG) complies with the SVG specification and can be viewed by SVG viewers. The SVG file can also be embedded in a web page and viewed in a web browser that has the appropriate plug-in to view SVG.

Since the SVG file uses a clear text representation to describe graphical information, the size of the generated file may be large depending on the length and density of graphical information present in your section of displayed log.

In addition to the graphical output, SVG hotspots are generated for items that have links in the document.

If you view the generated SVG file in a browser (such as Internet ExplorerÔ), the items with links (e.g. a core symbol) will have a hotspot. When your mouse is over such an item in your web browser, the mouse pointer will change to a hand and double-clicking should take you to the linked item.

In the following example, a reference to a generated SVG filee:\temp\test.svghas been embedded into an HTML page.

The height and width should correspond to the size of the graphic image in the SVG file. This is especially useful for efficient scrolling of relatively long sections of log in a Web browser.

<EMBED SRC="e:\temp\test.svg" NAME="SVGEmbed" TYPE="image/svg-xml" PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/" height=10000 width=1000>



The TIFF export option can be used to replicate the GEO plot in to a commonly used graphics format. This file can then be viewed within many third party graphics applications.

The TIFF feature can be used to export the plot as a whole, however for large plots, in both width and length there are some associated limits to be aware of.

There are two controls for exporting to TIFF format -DPIandPageHeight.Both of these options can be edited on theEdittab inEdit GEO Settings(Generaltab).

The following video selects WMF as the export format. Simply replace this selection with TIFF.

Tip. If you experience memory issues during this process, try reducing the DPI.



WMF is useful for transferring asmallsection of the plot into another application such as MS WordÔor MS PowerPointÔ.

We do specify asmallsection of the plot, primarily because of two reasons;

GEO can also export the plot to a Placeable WMF.

The only difference between the standard WMF and the placeable WMF is the presence of an additional 20-byte header in the latter.

Export a section of plot to WMF

On theDepthtab, enter the Index Range you wish to export inFromandTo.

On theExporttab, selectExportas...then eitherWMF-Standard Metafile,Placeable WMForWMF-Metafile picture to clipboard.

AnExportTodialog box will open (unless you selectWMF-Metafile picture to clipboard).  Enter aFilenameand the directory where it is going to be stored.

If the plot is exported asWMF-Metafile picture to clipboard, bring it to the other application by pasting it.

Tip.The best route to bring the plot to your MS PowerPointÔfor presentation is to specify the zone of interest depth range and export the plot either as WMF-Metafile picture to clipboard or EMF-Enhanced Metafile to clipboard. Then paste it to MS PowerPointÔ.



Adjust the amount of vertical graphic in each individual graphic file.

On theDepthtab, enter the Index Range you wish to export inFromandTo.

On theExporttab, selectHTML Using...thenchoose your preferred image format.

AnExportTodialog box will open.  Enter aFilenameand the directory where it is going to be stored.



The ODF Update File or OUF, which was introduced with version 4 of GEO Software, enables you to send daily updates with a high level of security, very cost effectively.

The prime purposes are:

Adding security when e-mailing files: This is because the OUF files must be loaded sequentially.

Reducing the size, and therefore cost, of e-mailing daily updates over expensive satellite links.

The OUF file only carries ‘Update’ information; as a result the size of the files is reduced substantially.

While an ODF is being created at the wellsite, the size and complexity of the file increases throughout the duration of the well, as progressively more data is added to it. The security of mailing the file becomes increasingly important, as do the actual costs involved. In the scenario where a wellsite user e-mails files to an operations base, the sending of the entire ODF on a daily basis can become inefficient. This is especially true when the recipient of the ODF is only concerned with the updates.

In the OUF model, the Wellsite user creates and maintains a Parent ODF. From this sequential OUF files are saved. These files are then mailed to the operations base and loaded to build an identical Child ODF. The OUF files must be loaded in the correct sequence to successfully build the Child ODF.

The scenario below attempts to show the best practice on how this OUF model may be conducted.

The first time the ODF is saved, you simply selectSave Asfrom theGEOmenu and supply a file name as normal. For instance, WellX.odf.

When the first transfer of data from the wellsite to operations base is required, you would simply selectSave OUF Updatesfrom theGEOmenu (orSendOUF Update Via Mailif you are going to send the file directly through an e-mail facility already present and set up in your PC – requires internet connection).

GEO takes the file name supplied and creates the first OUF file. For instance, WellX-001.ouf. You would then e-mail, disk-fax or modem transfer the ‘WellX-001.ouf’ to the operations base, instead of the WellX.odf.

Because of its in-built compressibility, the resultant OUF file will always be smaller than the Parent ODF, although for the very first transmission, there probably will not be such a marked difference in file sizes as is noticeable with the subsequent OUFs.

Between transfers, the wellsite user can of course keep the Parent ODF up-to-date and saved on the local drive by using the normal Save procedure from the GEO menu.

For the next transfer, you would again select Save OUF Updates or Send OUF Update Via Mail.

GEO will then save this update as an OUF, called WellX-002.ouf.

Note. Saving the WellX-002.ouf will simultaneously save the WellX.odf to the same point.

If you select Save As instead of Save OUF Updates it would result in a GEO warning message (840) advising you that saving the ODF to another name would break the connection between this ODF and all subsequent OUFs’.

Hence, say if the ODF was saved under a different name e.g. WellZ.odf. The next time you go to Save OUF Updates the OUF would revert to WellZ-001.ouf because of the name change. All the information loaded would then be encapsulated in this new OUF under the newly named ODF.

At the Operations Base

You have two options for loading the OUF file.

Double-clicking on the OUF e-mail attachment. This would launch GEO and load the OUF file automatically.

Detaching the e-mail attachment and selecting Load OUF Updates from the GEO menu

After loading the 001.ouf, the file must be saved as an ODF. You can give a file name as appropriate. The ODF created is often called the ‘Child’ ODF. Each time an OUF is received and loaded, the ODF is saved prior to loading subsequent OUFs. This ensures the child ODF is at the correct stage to load the next OUF in sequence.

The OUFs must be loaded in sequence. If the wellsite user accidentally sends 004.ouf without previously sending 003.ouf the operations base user cannot load the file. This is an important security element of the OUF file.

Please note, that OUF files may be opened and viewed within the full viewer application, GEOView.

OUF files cannot be opened directly using the free viewer, GEOe-View.

Files must first be consolidated within an ODF file (using GEO or GEOView).

After the ODF has beene-View enabled(using GEO), it may only then be freely shared with users of the GEOe-View application.

Note. In addition to the GEO Plus application, OUF files may be opened and viewed within the full viewer application, GEOView.

OUF files cannot be opened directly using the free viewer,GEOe-View.

Files must first be consolidated within an ODF file (using GEO or GEOView).

After the ODF has beene-View enabled(using GEO), it may only then be freely shared with users of the GEOe-Viewapplication.

What happens if the OUF connection is broken?

Any amendments made in the PARENT ODF, and the OUF subsequently created, will over-ride changes made in the Child ODF. The Replication Information dialog box serves to advise the operations base user, if an amendment made in the Child ODF, has also been changed in the OUF they are loading. This is the only scenario where aReplicationInformationdialog box is invoked detailing a Replication Conflict.

The operations base user loads an OUF. They then move a casing shoe symbol from 4000ft to 4500ft, and save the child ODF. The next OUF received includes the same casing shoe having been moved in the PARENT ODF from 4000ft to 4250ft. When the operations base user loads this OUF they will first see aReplicationInformationdialog box. This advises the operations base user that a change made to the child ODF has also been changed in the parent ODF. Exiting the dialog box will over-write the change made by the operations user in the child ODF. After loading this OUF the casing shoe will be moved to 4250ft.

GEO takes the OUF to be loaded and checks the contents of this OUF against the contents of the child ODF.

In the above example, the Replication Information dialog box would not have been produced if the symbol had not been moved in the PARENT ODF. The child ODF can be altered any number of times without invoking the ‘Replication Conflict’, as long as an alteration using the same log object has not been implemented in the parent ODF.

A sandstone block has two pyritic modifiers at 3000ft. GEO assigns these modifiers their own unique id numbers (e.g. 20 & 21). The child ODF is altered, by shifting modifier 20 to 2995ft and then saved. The PARENT ODF is altered, by shifting modifier 21 to 3005ft. The next sequential OUF is then saved. When this OUF is loaded into the child ODF, aReplicationInformationdialog box will not open.

If however, in a later OUF, modifier 20 is shifted from 3000ft to 3005ft, upon loading this OUF aReplicationInformationdialog box is opened. This is because the OUF records the shift from 3000ft to 3005ft in the parent ODF. When scanning the child ODF, GEO by default, assumes the modifier to be positioned at 3000ft but upon loading the OUF scans and records the same modifier (20), positioned at 2995ft. This ‘deviation’ invokes theReplicationInformationdialog box.



Save an ODF file in the normal way by clickingSave Asfrom theGEOmenu.

Create an OUF file from that ODF by selectingSave OUF UpdatesfromGEOmenu.

Any amendments in the ODF file can then be saved into OUF format by selectingSave OUF UpdatefromGEOmenu. This at the same time will save the ODF file.

Note. Alternatively, if your e-mail software has been setup, clickSend OUF updates via Mailfrom theGEOmenu. This method also creates an OUF file with a sequentially-numbered file name, and in addition incorporates the OUF into an e-mail as the correctly named file-attachment.

Tip.Do not rename OUF files. GEO gives the OUF the same filename as its PARENT ODF together with its sequence number.



Upon receiving an OUF file, load the file either by detaching the e-mail attachments or by selectingLoad OUF Updatesfrom theGEOmenu.

Locate the OUF file andOpen.

Save the file as an ODF file in the normal way (clickSave Asfrom theGEOmenu). This saves the ‘Child’ ODF onto your machine.

Repeat these steps to load the sequential incoming OUF files and save them into one ODF file to create the local replica (or child) of the PARENT ODF.



The Auto merge OUF feature allows users to load OUF files received (from wellsite or well partner) at a user-defined frequency (or time interval).

This frequency can be set by entering the appropriate value (in minutes) atAuto Merge OUFs everybox at theOthertab ofGlobal Settingsdialog box(on theEdittab).

The feature is disabled by default as the frequency is set at 0 (zero) minutes.

To enable the feature, simply specify the frequency at which the application should ‘check’ for new OUF files to auto-merge into the child ODF.

AnOUF Loaddirectory must be specified from theFile Locationstab of theRegistry Editordialog box. This dialog box can be launched from GEO by selectingEdit GEO Settingsfrom theEdittab.

At the user-defined frequency specified, the application reverts to the location specified for theOUF Load Directoryto check for the new OUF files. The procedure is as follows:

Load the first OUF file by clickingLoad OUF Updatesfrom the GEO menu.

Once the first OUF has been loaded, you must save it as anODFfile.

From this point, the software will revert to the folder location specified, at the user-defined frequency, to check for and load the next sequential OUF file(s).

If the next expected file is present in the OUF Load folder, and the relevant ODF file open, the software will confirm whether you wish to load that sequential OUF. If multiple sequential OUF files are encountered, these can be loaded in turn.

Note. If the frequency of transmission of OUF files from the wellsite is increased, if only to match the realistic acquisition of data, then this feature may be deployed to provide an often operationally satisfactory ‘near-real time’ data stream to the operations base.



What happens if somehow the chain of OUF file is broken (for instance, lost during sending) and cannot be re-sent? There is an OUF re-save feature that enables the parent OUF user to re-save over previously saved OUFs.

The wellsite user saves 007.ouf after loading new data. This data happens to be corrupt and upon mailing, the recipient experiences difficulty loading the OUF. When the 007 is re-sent, the same problem occurs again so the well site user becomes aware of the problem. The corrupt data is stripped from the ODF, and new data is reloaded.

You selectSave OUF Updatesfrom theGEO menuand GEO saves the OUF as 008. This OUF cannot be loaded by the user in the operation base, since the last OUF loaded successfully was 006 and the OUFs must be loaded in sequence.

The wellsite user can clickResave Range of OUF Updatesfrom theGEOmenu and select the 007.ouf from the list in theDescriptioncolumn of the dialog box.

ClickingSavewill create a 007_009.ouf. The 007_ portion of this filename is created because the operations user must have a 007.ouf to maintain the sequence. The _009 portion is created because the wellsite user created a 008.ouf incorrectly. This must now be by-passed since the 008.ouf required the original 007.ouf to load correctly.

The next OUF created by the wellsite user will be 010.ouf. The operations user will be able to load this 010.ouf because the last OUF loaded was the 007_009.ouf and the _009 portion of this OUF maintains the sequence.

If an OUF sequence is ever broken, for any reasons, theResave Range of OUF Updatesoption from theGEOmenu can be utilized to successfully re-establish the link.

If the recipient user accidentally deleted the child ODF and the constituent OUFs, the link could always be re-established as long as the parent ODF exists.

In an extreme scenario, the wellsite user, after saving 1000 OUFs could clickRe-Save Range of OUF Updatesand select number 001.ouf from the dialog box list. GEO would then create a 001_1001.ouf, which would include every well data amendment and addition in those 1000 OUFs. This could be e-mailed to the operations base user, loaded, and saved as a new child ODF.

The next OUF saved by the wellsite user will be 1002.ouf. The operations base user could then load this OUF without any problem.



In most cases, the OUF will be sent from one place to another as an e-mail attachment. There are two ways to place the OUF as an e-mail attachment:

By attaching the OUF files manually within your e-mail software itself.

UsingSend OUF Updates via Mail(from the GEO menu) feature in GEO.

If theSend OUF Updates via Mailfeature is utilized, you do not need to click theSave OUF Updatesto save the sequential OUF. Pointing atSend OUF Updates via Mailand clicking theUpdatesoption automatically saves the next sequential OUF file.

For first time usage, you need to go through the following procedure to set it up:

On the GEO meny, selectSend OUF Updates via Mailto open theChoose Profiledialog box. It allows you to select the information service by which the OUF file will be mailed. You can set up your choice of information service using the Windows Messaging Set-Up Wizard. Once selected, this invokes your installed e-mail software (for example MS Outlook) and opens the Message dialog box.

The Message dialog box consists of two tabs -MessageandOptions.

TheMessagetab allows you to enter the address (or addresses) of theOUF recipient(s). You can enter any desired text here, which is then mailed along with the OUF file.

TheOptionstab allows you to set several options relating to the conditions under which the mail is sent. The Importance Level, Delivery Options and Tracking Options can all be set from this tab.

Next time you clickSend OUF Updates via Mailfrom theGEOmenu, the corresponding OUF will be saved and it will open your e-mail software with the OUF automatically created as the attachment. You can type the message as normal prior to sending this e-mail.

In the event that you not complete theSend OUF via Mailsequence and quit partially through the steps (e.g. you do not really send the e-mail), GEO will inform you that the OUF file has already been saved (specifying the file path) and that the particular OUF must be sent manually (as an e-mail attachment, for example).

If you clickSendRange ofOUF Updates via Mail, aRe-Save range of updatesdialog box opens. Click the row which details the OUF sequence number to be saved over. ClickSaveand this will create an underscore OUF number that can be sent as an e-mail attachment.



With the VUF feature it is possible to transferODFfiles quickly, efficiently and in real time between remote locations via an Internet connection. This feature is also used to publish the ODF into a web folder.

The ODF is divided into multiple VUF files based on chunk size (in pixels), which are compressed during the saving process and then published to a web folder. The VUF files can then be streamed in, in a sequential manner, decompressing as they do.

Click File from the GEO menu bar and select Stream Out VUFs; a dialog box will appear.

Enter the FULL URL for the Web folder directory or path for the File directory that you want to store the VUF files in.

Enter a Chunk Size in pixels (i.e. the amount of pixels you wish to be in each separate VUF file).

Selecting one of the Chunks Ordered option buttons allows you to select the sequence that the files are saved in, e.g. descending (bottom of log to top) or ascending (top of log to bottom).

Define what chunk you want to save the headers and trailers in (e.g. chunk one, two or at the end) by selecting the appropriate option button.

Select Save to publish the file, orCancelto abort.

Open GEO (or GEOViewor GEOe-View) and click File from the menu bar and select Stream In VUFs.

Enter the FULL URL for the Web folder directory or path for the File directory, followed by the file name of the VUF files

Note. Name of first VUF file will be the ODF file name succeeded by ‘-001.vuf’

Select OK to begin streaming in, or Cancel to abort.

Tip. Large graphics in the headers and trailers will significantly decrease streaming speeds.

The bigger the chunk size in pixels, the longer it will take the first file to stream in, however a bigger chunk size will generate less chunks, thus total time may be slightly decreased.

As a guide we recommend a chunk size of approx 800 pixels.



A sidetrack well can be created from any ODF you have saved. This will allow you to select an existing well, and at a given depth truncate that well so that from that Kick Off Point you can add new data and new interpretations for the new sidetrack.

To create a Sidetrack:

Ensure your ODF is saved (on theGEOtab, selectSave)

On theGEOtab, selectCreateSidetrack...The Create Sidetrack dialog box will open.

Enter theKickoff Depth for Sidetrack.

ClickOK.TheSave Sidetrack to Documentbox will open.

Afile nameand save location for your sidetrack will be suggested. Change if required.

The ‘sidetrack’ ODF will open on returning to GEO.



Symbols are used to add important information to the plot.

On theSymbolstab, select the symbol from theSymbolpalette.Use the arrows to view more symbol types.

The cursor will become the symbol selected.Place it over the track where you want the symbol to appear and click.

HitEscor click on the ribbon to exit modifier mode.



Select the symbol and hitDeleteon your keyboard.

Right click on the symbol and selectDelete.

A confirmation dialog box will open. ClickYes.



Select the symbol and drag it to its new position.

On theHometab, selectArrow Keys Nudge. Use the arrow keys to move the symbol to its new position.

Move symbols with precision

Right click on the symbol.TheSymbol Informationdialog box will open.

Change theX-PositionandAtdepth to place the symbol.Note.the symbol will have a reference point (REF1) which will be used for the placement of that symbol.



Tables store tabular information, that relates to specific symbols on the plot.

This information may appear in the plot header or trailer, with its corresponding symbol on the log.

For example, shot number information recorded in the SWC table, could be displayed next to the SWC symbols in the plot.

There are two ways to launch the table definition dialog box in which you can enter data.

If there are tables in the header, double click on it to launch theTable Definitiondialog box.Or,

If there are no header tables, on theHometab, selectCreate Table from Template.

Select a CategoryandSelect a Table Template.

ClickApply. The Table Definition dialog box will open.

Select the cell to be edited and enter the data.Note. The Start Depth defines the position of any symbols associated with the data.

Use thetabkey to move from one cell to another.

At the last cell, you will need to hitEnteron your keyboard to confirm the data.

Use theAppendRow,Insert RowandDeleteRowto edit rows.



At some point, you may want to edit an existing table template with more columns, different column labels or even different default symbols. You may want to create a completely new table template for ease of entering data specific to your odf.

See the software's limits on how many tables you can put in one ODF file.

Important. The master resource for table templates is theGeoTable.inifile which houses all the information needed to create a table. GEO will use this set of templates for every new ODF made on a particular machine. However, once an ODF or ODT is created the table templates are automatically saved in the document so that the template list is also saved if the file is to be shared and perhaps modified on another machine. It is now far easier for template information to stay integral and thus safer. Similarly, if a colleague sends you an ODF the templates would be inherent in the document, there would not be as before the possibility of the document reading your own master GeoTable.ini file.

Table Template Editing/Creating

The table templates can be created or amended in theRegistry Editor. On theEdittab, selectEdit GEO Settings. TheRegistry Editorwill open. Select theTable Templatetab.

Select the template you wish to edit fromChoose a Table Template. Or to create a new template, select an<undefined>number.

Define or adjust theTable Template IDandNameif necessary.

If you intend the symbol to have a start and end depth, like a core symbol, tickREF1andREF2.

Choose the Layouts that you want the symbols to display in by selecting from theSelect Layouts where Symbols should Display.

Select aCategorytype that your table will belong to. Type in the blank space to add a new category.

Choose the default symbol that is selected when you apply the table inDefaults for Symbol in Table Rows. Enter theTrackNumberand theX Offsetto define where the symbol will be placed, in relation toREF1.Note. SelectNo Symbolto disable all the symbol options.

Choose other symbols to be selectable in your table in theSelect List of Symbols for this Table with associated Column. You can also make the symbol choice depending on certain Column Text (see below section).

Define the tableColumnsand their relatedParameters.

Field Name– Enter the title that will represent your column.

Data Type– Choose from many data types to restrict the information that is added to a cell.

>>- Allows computation between table columns within the table template. Select the grey button to the right of the cell to invoke theComputed Fielddialog box. Define the calculation by selecting a column fromParameter 1, theOperatorrequired and another column fromParameter 2, then clickOK.

Format– Enter the format of the data type. For example, set decimal place number, or format for date entry or time entry.

Width– Enter the maximum number of characters you will be able to enter.

Justification– Define the justification for the column data. This is especially relevant if the table is to appear in the header or trailer.

Postfix– Enter text that will automatically follow the cell value. System variables can be used here; enter the relevant code to enable (%%InxUnits"S or L).

Tooltip– Selecting Yes will make this columns data appear when you hover over the symbol with the mouse when displayed in the plot.

Value List– SeeColumn/Symbol Textsection below.

Note. For computation in tables, theDataTypemust be defined asComputedto assess this section. All table columns defined as integer/decimal/date/time/date & time/start and end depths/start or end TWTs will be listed in theParameterfields.

Note. Foroperational diaryandremarkstables please ensure that theTable Typeis defined asOperational DiaryorOperational Remarksas appropriate.

It is possible to make the symbol selection dependent on the text entered in a particular column.

Setup yourlist of symbolsand enter the text that will invoke the used of this symbol.

Define the columnyou wish the symbol choice to be based on and set asSymColTxttype.

The text you enter in this column in the actual table can be freehand, or preset in theValue List. In the example above you see theValue Listpopulated by related information. Choosing the valueV Highwould automatically choose theHazard Very Highsymbol. Build your Value list by entering the text, followed by a ‘|’ character.

Note. If the old table template has been opened, you cannot apply the new edited template unless youdelete the old format from the table.

If a table requires data to be uploaded/imported from a WitsML server you need to assign a relevant Object to the table by selecting from the drop down menu. You also will need to define which element is to be used for the depth, again using the drop down menu.Another method to edit or create a table template is by editing thegeotable.inifile itself, which actually houses the table template definitions.



The content of a table can be easily exported to the clipboard and pasted into another application, such as MS ExcelTM, MS WordTMor Notepad.

In the GEOHometab, select the table from theSelect Definitionbox.

ClickExport. This will export the content of the table to the clipboard.

Open another application, such as MS ExcelTM, MS WordTMor Notepad, andPastefrom the clipboard. This will bring in the table values exported from the clipboard.



The geotable.ini file which usually resides in the Windows directory (or under Documents and Settings) houses the table template definitions.

The table template definitions in this geotable.ini file can be applied through theTable Definitiondialog box.

Editing the table template by editing this .ini file is the same as editing that same table template through theTableTemplatetab in theRegistryEditordialog box.

Editing via theRegistryEditoris more user friendly to many users due to the easier interface, although any changes made will then update the details in the geotable.ini file.

This is an example of the structure of the geotable.ini.

The ID that will be applied to the table.

The name that will appear in the heading of a Table.

Normal, OpsDiary or Operations Remarks - these are the 3 options to determine if the table is used in reporting or normally.

A field (column) definition. Heading for the field, size of field in characters, justification (L/R/C) for Left, Right or Center.

The default symbol. This must exist in the ODF file where the table is used.

A symbol will be related to this track by default.

Justification for Depth values (L/R/C) for Left, Right or Center.

To allow entry of End Depth in Tables dialog box for symbols with REF2.

The offset of the symbol in Screen units (mm or inches) from the left edge of the track.

Specifies zero relative column number to use as deviation/dip in degrees to rotate symbol.

See the software's limits on how many tables you can put in one ODF file.

You can present the True Vertical Depth (TVD) in your log, just by itself, or together with the Measured Depth (MD).

In GEO, we call those two depth references as primary and alternate depth system.

Since we do not build any algorithm to convert the MD into TVD in the software, the user needs to have the MD versus TVD data loaded as a curve. Such data can often be obtained from the vendor of survey data (nowadays, often the MWD company). Then the software needs to be told which data is going to be used for MD-TVD calculation and determine which depth system is going to be displayed.

Inform the software which data is going to be used for MD-TVD calculation

On theDepthtab in theConversiongroup, select TVD from theCurvedrop list.

Check theUse Data for TVD Conversionbox.

If a subsea correction needs to be applied, checkTVDSSCorrectionand enter the value in theTVDSSCorrectiontext box. To present it as a negative value, tickTVDSS as Negative.

The following information is based around creating plot objects using the VLCP - Vector Language Compiler Program, a feature which comes as a standard with the GEO for Window application.In conjunction with the VLCP package, GEO is packaged with a simpler drawing application called VectDraw, which allows you to create or modify log objects using a more user-friendly graphics interface.

Log objects such as symbols, modifiers, lithology patterns, headers, trailers and tables that appear on the plot, can all be customized by you.

But before we examine how we do that, it is important to understand some of the basic concepts.

Objects such as a Casing Shoe or a Core symbol are symbol definitions. Similarly, a Lithology log header is a header definition.

Each definition has a unique filename and is organized in a directory structure with other allied definitions. This directory is known as the Library, and is comprised of sub folders for Lithology, Structures, Symbols, Modifiers, and Headers.

In general, all header definitions will appear in the headers folder, the default file path for which is \GEO for Windows\Library\Headers. Likewise, all modifier definitions appear in the modifiers folder (default being \GEO for Windows\Library\Modifiers).Note.The directory for those objects may be different from that above, depending on path specifications allocated or chosen during software installation.

All GEO software uses a custom format for defining such objects, which are referred to as Vector Objects .

They are stored on disk in two distinct forms:

The text file that may be created or modified by the user. The file has a .VOT extension, so it is usually called a VOT file.

The binary file created by compiling the corresponding VOT file, or alternatively by direct creation using the Vectdraw package. This file has a .VOB extension and hence it is commonly called a VOB file.

When you first start a session of GEO, it polls the relevant directories and organizes the definitions (VOB files) found in them in an appropriate fashion. For instance, the symbol definitions appear as menu items under the Symbols menu. Similarly, the lithology definitions appear in the Lithology Information dialog box.

Vector objects are made up of lines, shapes, texts, table-related text or mnemonics. Symbols are created by using these elements and specifying their dimensions.The dimension of a vector object may be specified to 1/10th of a millimeter. As a result, the symbols can be very precise. Vector objects have the distinct advantage over bitmapped objects in that they do not distort when sized.

Certain objects within GEO (Symbols, Modifiers, Headers) may also be bitmaps. Typically they are stored on disk in files with a .BMP extension.

The program only accepts two color bitmaps. Typically, they are black and white. Bitmaps may be created by any graphics application.

Depending on the complexity of the bitmaps, they may distort when scaled (aliasing).

Scaling factors, to cope with resolution differences between screen and printer need to be specified in the Zoom factor Bitmaps on Screen on the General tab of the Registry Editor dialog box.Note.Some high-end plotters cannot plot bitmaps.



Vector Objects (symbols, modifiers, headers) can be defined or customized by creating a text file and saving it as a VOT file.

A VOT file constructed using Vector Object Definition Language, can be edited and compiled using the VLCP feature included in a full GEO license.

On theToolstab, selectVLCPCompilerto open theGEO-Define Vector Object.

Select the VOT file to be edited or compiled.

Edit the VOT as required.

Click Save VOB to save VOB into your selected folder.Note. It is strongly recommended that you save the VOBs into their appropriate folder. For example. a new symbol vob would be saved to GEO for Windows/Library/Symbols.



On theGEOtab, selectClose.

If there are unsaved changes a message will appear asking if you would like to save them. SelectYes,NoorCancelas required.

The GEO application will remain open, ready to open another ODF. To close the application, select the cross in the top right corner.



Files reside in directories located on the in-use disk, where they are identified by their names.

By default, GEO files reside in the following location (unless formatted differently on installation).

ExampleODF filesC:\Users\*username*\Documents\MyWells

ExampleTemplatesC:\Users\*username*\AppData\Roaming\SDC Software\Geo Suite 8\Geo\Templates

File names are in the form of a name (given by a user) and an extension specific to the file type.

The name can be up to 255 characters long (including the space and path names), while the extension (after the period [.]) is usually 3 characters long.

The File menu is used to control file related activities such as opening, closing and saving files as well as printing and loading data, or importing %lithology from an ASCII file.



Note. CGM is standard feature in GEO, while OUF is a standard feature only in GEO and GEOLite.

Open the layout you wish to load the VEW file into.

On theGEO(file) menu, selectOpenthenBrowse.

In theOpendialog box, locate and select the .VEW file you wish to load (ensure .VEW is selected in the file type drop list).

The track format for the current layout will be replaced by that of the Vew file.



If an ODF file, has a data range of 0-10000ft, but only a specific depth range, 7000-8000ft is of interest, sending an ODF with the remaining 9000ft of data is unnecessary and inefficient. Instead, an OIF file containing the 7000-8000ft of data can be saved, creating a much smaller file.

Display the depth range required. On theDepthtab, enter theFromandToindex range i.e. 7000-8000.

On theGEOmenu, selectSave Displayed Depth or Time interval As (OIF)…

Enter aFilenameand selectSave.



A template (ODT) can be created from fresh or from an existing ODF file. This means once a preferred format has been created it can be saved as a template and utilized thereafter.

Unlike a View file (a file with VEW extension), which only saves the track layout, the template function saves all the ODF constituents in a template format. This ensures that preferred components, such as library files (i.e. lithology, headers with included location maps, symbols, modifiers) are incorporated into the template. Any plot objects in the ODF will also be incorporated into the template saved.

Once an ODT file has been created, it may be distributed to other users.

The ODT file is a powerful tool when a final log format has been approved. The ODT file will always contain library information (headers, lithology, modifiers, structures, and symbols), view file contents (track layout information, depth and screen units, scale and pen information (optional)) and ini file settings (curve defaults, computed curves and table definitions).

GEONet Template Customization Service

Create your own Template

You can create an ODT from an ODF using a wizard, which allows users to include or omit further plot elements from an existing ODF.

ODT Document Information

This option allows you to see information within the ODT organized in a tree structure. It will warn you if some components of the ODT are not functioning correctly or have settings that are deemed not best practice.

When creating a template you can consult the document information tree to see what warnings appear, that would otherwise be not obvious. You can therefore attempt to rectify them.



The ODF Update File or OUF, enables you to send daily updates with a high level of security, very cost effectively.

The prime purposes are adding security when e-mailing files (the OUF files must be loaded sequentially) and reducing the size, and therefore cost, of e-mailing daily updates over expensive satellite links.

The OUF file only carries ‘Update’ information; as a result the size of the files is reduced substantially.

While an ODF is being created at the wellsite, the size and complexity of the file increases throughout the duration of the well, as progressively more data is added to it. The security of mailing the file becomes increasingly important, as do the actual costs involved. In the scenario where a wellsite user e-mails files to an operations base, the sending of the entire ODF on a daily basis can become inefficient. This is especially true when the recipient of the ODF is only concerned with the updates.

In the OUF model, the Wellsite user creates and maintains a Parent ODF. From this is saved sequential OUF files. These files are then mailed to the operations base and loaded to build an identical Child ODF. The OUF files must be loaded in the correct sequence to successfully build the Child ODF.The scenario below attempts to show the best practice on how this OUF model may be conducted.

The first time the ODF is saved, you simply selectSaveAsfrom theGEOmenu and supply a file name as normal. For instance, WellX.odf.

When the first transfer of data from the wellsite to operations base is required, you would simply selectSave OUF Updatesfrom theGEOmenu (orSendOUF Update Via Mailif you are going to send the file directly through an e-mail facility already present and set up in your PC – requires internet connection).

GEO takes the file name supplied and creates the first OUF file. For instance, WellX-001.ouf. You would then e-mail, disk-fax or modem transfer the ‘WellX-001.ouf’ to the operations base, instead of the WellX.odf.

Because of its in-built compressibility, the resultant OUF file will always be smaller than the Parent ODF, although for the very first transmission, there probably will not be such a marked difference in file sizes as is noticeable with the subsequent OUFs.

Between transfers, the wellsite user can of course keep the Parent ODF up-to-date and saved on the local drive by using the normal Save procedure from the GEO menu.

For the next transfer, you would again select Save OUF Updates or Send OUF Update Via Mail.

GEO will then save this update as an OUF, called WellX-002.ouf.

Note. Saving the WellX-002.ouf will simultaneously save the WellX.odf to the same point.

If you select Save As instead of Save OUF Updates it would result in a GEO warning message (840) advising you that saving the ODF to another name would break the connection between this ODF and all subsequent OUFs’.

Hence, say if the ODF was saved under a different name e.g. WellZ.odf. The next time you go to Save OUF Updates the OUF would revert to WellZ-001.ouf because of the name change. All the information loaded would then be encapsulated in this new OUF under the newly named ODF.At the Operations Base

You have two options for loading the OUF file.

Double-clicking on the OUF e-mail attachment. This would launch GEO and load the OUF file automatically.

Detaching the e-mail attachment and selecting Load OUF Updates from the GEO menu

After loading the 001.ouf, the file must be saved as an ODF. You can give a file name as appropriate. The ODF created is often called the ‘Child’ ODF. Each time an OUF is received and loaded, the ODF is saved prior to loading subsequent OUFs. This ensures the child ODF is at the correct stage to load the next OUF in sequence.

The OUFs must be loaded in sequence. If the wellsite user accidentally sends 004.ouf without previously sending 003.ouf the operations base user cannot load the file. This is an important security element of the OUF file.

Please note, that OUF files may be opened and viewed within the full viewer application, GEOView.

OUF files cannot be opened directly using the free viewer, GEOe-View.

Files must first be consolidated within an ODF file (using GEO or GEOView).

After the ODF has beene-View enabled(using GEO), it may only then be freely shared with users of the GEOe-View application.

What happens if the OUF connection is broken?

Any amendments made in the PARENT ODF, and the OUF subsequently created, will over-ride changes made in the Child ODF. The Replication Information dialog box serves to advise the operations base user, if an amendment made in the Child ODF, has also been changed in the OUF they are loading. This is the only scenario where aReplicationInformationdialog box is invoked detailing a Replication Conflict.

The operations base user loads an OUF. They then move a casing shoe symbol from 4000ft to 4500ft, and save the child ODF. The next OUF received includes the same casing shoe having been moved in the PARENT ODF from 4000ft to 4250ft. When the operations base user loads this OUF they will first see aReplicationInformationdialog box. This advises the operations base user that a change made to the child ODF has also been changed in the parent ODF. Exiting the dialog box will over-write the change made by the operations user in the child ODF. After loading this OUF the casing shoe will be moved to 4250ft.

GEO takes the OUF to be loaded and checks the contents of this OUF against the contents of the child ODF.

In the above example, the Replication Information dialog box would not have been produced if the symbol had not been moved in the PARENT ODF. The child ODF can be altered any number of times without invoking the ‘Replication Conflict’, as long as an alteration using the same log object has not been implemented in the parent ODF.

A sandstone block has two pyritic modifiers at 3000ft. GEO assigns these modifiers their own unique id numbers (e.g. 20 & 21). The child ODF is altered, by shifting modifier 20 to 2995ft and then saved. The PARENT ODF is altered, by shifting modifier 21 to 3005ft. The next sequential OUF is then saved. When this OUF is loaded into the child ODF, aReplicationInformationdialog box will not open.

If however, in a later OUF, modifier 20 is shifted from 3000ft to 3005ft, upon loading this OUF aReplicationInformationdialog box is opened. This is because the OUF records the shift from 3000ft to 3005ft in the parent ODF. When scanning the child ODF, GEO by default, assumes the modifier to be positioned at 3000ft but upon loading the OUF scans and records the same modifier (20), positioned at 2995ft. This ‘deviation’ invokes theReplicationInformationdialog box.

The Output Database File or ODF is the compact database file created by GEO.It contains all information needed for rapid recall of all data relating to a particular well, either for further editing/update or for recreating the log.The main components of an ODF are:

Any loaded curve data and information about their source.

Layout related information, such as tracks, and the log scale

Information about geological interpretation data, such as lithology, symbol and modifiers.

Information that you input, such as remarks, texts, tables and headers / trailers.

All libraries and fonts of the system in which the ODF was first created.

Embedded objects, such as documents, spreadsheets, maps, diagrams, photographs, etc.

Links to related external documents, such as reports, spreadsheets, photographs, other ODFs, etc.

ODF files may be shared with other members of the team (or with well partners) who require read-only access to the log and embedded curve data, using GEOView, or the free viewer, GEOe-View.For added security, an ODF must first be made e-View enabled before it can be opened by GEOe-View. The bottom status bar will state if the open ODF is e-View enabled or disabled. If disabled, right click on it and select e-View enabled.Both GEOView and GEOe-View can operate as ‘plug-in’ controls to the Internet Explorer web browser, so effectively allowing ODF files to be opened (normally by clicking a hyperlink to the ODF on an intranet web-page) within this standard browser.(If you are interested in setting-up a corporate intranet for securely-sharing your well data, please contact your local office ofGeologix Limited. We shall be pleased to discuss your requirements and to offer our expertise within a range of service solutions).



When an ODF file is saved in GEO, all curve data along with any other data such as lithology, modifiers, symbols, and texts will be saved. In addition, all other information that is required to reproduce the log as it was at the time of saving (such as track layout, curve presentation attributes, zoom factors, header/trailer layout and mnemonics) is also saved.
