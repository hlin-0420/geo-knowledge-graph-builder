ODF files may be shared with other members of the team (or with well partners) who require read-only access to the log and embedded curve data, using GEOView, or the free viewer, GEOe-View.

For added security, an ODF must first be madee-View enabledbefore it can be opened by GEOe-View. The bottom status bar will state if the open ODF is e-View enabled or disabled. If disabled, right click on it and select e-View enabled.

Both GEOView and GEOe-View can operate as ‘plug-in’ controls to the Internet Explorer web browser, so effectively allowing ODF files to be opened (normally by clicking a hyperlink to the ODF on an intranet web-page) within this standard browser.

If you are interested in setting-up a corporate intranet for securely-sharing your well data, please contact your local office ofGeologix. We shall be pleased to discuss your requirements and to offer our expertise within a range of service solutions.
